## Liftgate

<!-- image -->

## Warning

Exhaust gases can enter the vehicle if it is driven with the liftgate or trunk/ hatch open, or with any objects that

(Continued)

## Warning (Continued)

pass through the seal between the body and the trunk/hatch or liftgate. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide (CO) which cannot be seen or smelled. It can cause unconsciousness and even death.

If the vehicle must be driven with the liftgate or trunk/hatch open:

- · Fully open the air outlets on or under the instrument panel.
- · Close all of the windows.
- · Adjust the climate control system to a setting that brings in only outside air and set the fan speed to the highest setting. See 'Climate Control Systems' in the Index.
- · If the vehicle is equipped with a power liftgate, disable the power liftgate function.

See Engine Exhaust 3 228 .

## Caution

To avoid damage to the liftgate or liftgate glass, make sure the area above and behind the liftgate is clear before opening it.

## Power Liftgate Operation

<!-- image -->

## Warning

You or others could be injured if caught in the path of the power liftgate. Make sure there is no one in the way of the liftgate as it is opening and closing.

## Caution

Driving with an open and unsecured liftgate may result in damage to the power liftgate components.

<!-- image -->

The power liftgate switch is on the overhead console. The vehicle must be in P (Park).

<!-- image -->

The modes are:

MAX: Opens to maximum height.

3/4: Opens to a reduced height that can be set from 3/4 to fully open. Use to prevent the liftgate from opening into overhead obstructions such as a garage door or roofmounted cargo. The liftgate can be manually opened all the way.

OFF: Opens manually only.

To power open or close the liftgate, select MAX or 3/4 mode and then:

- · Press b twice quickly on the remote key until the liftgate moves.
- · Press l on the bottom edge of the liftgate next to the latch to close.

Press any liftgate button, the emblem, or b on the remote key while the liftgate is moving to stop it. Pressing any liftgate button or pressing b twice quickly on the remote key restarts the operation in the reverse direction. Pressing the emblem will restart the motion, but only in the opening direction.

## Caution

Manually forcing the liftgate to open or close during a power cycle can damage the vehicle. Allow the power cycle to complete.

- · Press 8 on the overhead console. The driver door must be unlocked or locked without the security armed.

<!-- image -->

- · Press the emblem under the liftglass, after unlocking all doors. A locked vehicle can be opened if the remote key is within 1 m (3 ft) of the emblem.

The power liftgate may be temporarily disabled in extremely low temperatures, or after repeated power cycling over a short period of time. If this occurs, the liftgate can still be operated manually.

If the vehicle is shifted out of P (Park) while the power function is in progress, the liftgate will continue to completion. If the vehicle is accelerated before the liftgate has completed moving, the liftgate may stop or reverse direction. Check for Driver Information Center (DIC) messages and make sure the liftgate is closed and latched before driving.

## Falling Liftgate Detection

If the power liftgate automatically closes after a power opening cycle, it indicates that the system is reacting to excess weight on the liftgate or a possible support strut failure. A repetitive chime will sound while the falling liftgate detection feature is operating. Remove any excess weight. If the liftgate continues to automatically close after opening, see your dealer for service before using the power liftgate.

Interfering with the power liftgate motion or manually closing the liftgate too quickly after power opening may resemble a support

strut failure. This could also activate the falling liftgate detection feature. Allow the liftgate to complete its operation and wait a few seconds before manually closing the liftgate.

## Obstacle Detection Features

If the liftgate encounters an obstacle during a power open or close cycle, the liftgate will automatically reverse direction and move a short distance away from the obstacle. After removing the obstruction, the power liftgate operation can be used again. If the liftgate encounters multiple obstacles on the same power cycle, the power function will deactivate. After removing the obstructions, manually close the liftgate. This will allow normal power operation functions to resume.

If the vehicle is locked while the liftgate is closing, and an obstacle is encountered that prevents the liftgate from completely closing, the horn will sound as an alert that the liftgate did not close.

## Setting the 3/4 Mode

To change the position the liftgate stops at when opening:

- 1. Select MAX or 3/4 mode and power open the liftgate.

- 2. Stop the liftgate movement at the desired height by pressing any liftgate button. Manually adjust the liftgate position if needed.
- 3. Press and hold l on the bottom edge of the liftgate next to the latch on the outside of the liftgate until the turn signals flash and a beep sounds. This indicates the setting has been recorded.

The liftgate cannot be set below a minimum programmable height. If there is no light flash or sound, then the height adjustment may be too low.

## Manual Operation

Select OFF to manually operate the liftgate.

## Caution

Attempting to move the liftgate too quickly and with excessive force may result in damage to the vehicle.

Operate the liftgate manually with a smooth motion and moderate speed. The system includes a feature which limits the manual closing speed to protect the components.

## Power Assist Steps

<!-- image -->

## Warning

To avoid personal injury or property damage, before entering or exiting the vehicle, be sure the power assist step is fully extended. Do not step on the power assist step while it is moving.  Never place hands or other body parts between the extended power assist step and the vehicle.

If equipped, the power assist steps, when enabled, will extend when the door is opened. They will retract three seconds after the door is closed or immediately if the vehicle starts moving.

Disable the power assist steps before jacking or placing any object under the vehicle. Too much ice buildup may prevent deployment of the power assist steps. Check the step position before exiting the vehicle. If this happens, disable the power assist steps, clear the ice, then enable the assist steps and confirm normal function prior to use.

Keep hands, children, pets, objects, and clothing clear of the power assist steps when in motion. The steps will reverse direction if there

is an obstruction. If possible, carefully remove the obstruction, then open and close the door on the same side to complete the motion. After obstacle detection, the boards will remain in their previous position (Extend/Stow) until another motion is requested. If the obstacle is not cleared and another motion is requested, the boards will make contact with the obstacle and then reverse to the previous position.

During automatic deployment, a warning will be displayed on the Driver Information Center (DIC) only when the running boards are obstructed.

## Enable/Disable

The power assist steps can be enabled or disabled. To view available settings from the infotainment screen, touch Settings > Vehicle > Power Assist Steps.

## Cleaning

The power assist steps can be extended or retracted for cleaning. To view available settings from the infotainment screen, touch Settings > Vehicle > Power Assist Steps.

## Vehicle Security

This vehicle has theft-deterrent features; however, they do not make the vehicle impossible to steal.

## Vehicle Alarm System

The indicator light, on the driver door near the window, indicates the status of the system. See Power Door Locks 3 17

<!-- image -->

## Arming the Alarm System

- 1. Turn off the vehicle.
- 2. Lock the vehicle in one of three ways:
- · Use the remote key.
- · Use the Keyless Access system.
- · With a door open, press Q on the interior of the door.
- 3. After 30 seconds the alarm system will arm, and the indicator light will begin to slowly flash. Pressing Q on the remote key a second time will bypass the 30-second delay and immediately arm the alarm system.

The vehicle alarm system will not arm if the doors are locked with the mechanical key.

If the driver door is opened without first unlocking with the remote key, the horn will chirp and the lights will flash to indicate prealarm. If the vehicle is not started, or the door is not unlocked by pressing K on the remote key during the 10-second pre-alarm, the alarm will be activated.

The alarm will also be activated if a passenger door, the liftgate, or the hood is opened without first disarming the system. When the alarm is activated, the turn signals flash and the horn sounds for about 30 seconds. The alarm system will then re-arm to monitor for the next unauthorized event.

## Disarming the Alarm System

To disarm the alarm system or turn off the alarm if it has been activated:

- · Unlock the vehicle using the Keyless Access system.
- · Press K on the remote key.
- · Start the vehicle.
- · Lock the vehicle after all occupants have exited.

To avoid setting off the alarm by accident:

- · Always unlock a door with the remote key, or use the Keyless Access system. Unlocking the driver door with the mechanical key will not disarm the system or turn off the alarm.

## How to Detect a Tamper Condition

If K is pressed on the remote key and the horn chirps three times, an alarm occurred previously while the alarm system was armed.

If the alarm has been activated, a message will appear on the DIC.

## Power Sounder, Inclination Sensor, and Intrusion Sensor

In addition to the standard theft-deterrent system features, this system may also have a power sounder, inclination sensor, and intrusion sensor.

The power sounder provides an audible alarm which is distinct from the vehicle's horn. It has its own power source, and can sound an alarm if the vehicle's battery is compromised.

The inclination sensor can set off the alarm if it senses movement of the vehicle, such as a change in vehicle orientation.

The intrusion sensor monitors the vehicle interior, and can activate the alarm if it senses unauthorized entry into the vehicle's interior. Do not allow passengers or pets to remain in the vehicle when the intrusion sensor is activated.

Before arming the theft-deterrent system and activating the intrusion sensor:

- · Secure any loose items such as a sunshades.
- · Make sure all doors and windows are completely closed.
- · Make sure there are no obstructions blocking the sensors in the front overhead console.

- · Close DVD screens before leaving the vehicle.

## Intrusion and Inclination Sensors Disable Switch

<!-- image -->

It is recommended that the intrusion and inclination sensors be deactivated if pets are left in the vehicle or the vehicle is being transported.

With the vehicle off, press o in the front overhead console to turn off the feature.

The indicator light may come on momentarily, or a message may display on the instrument cluster, indicating that these sensors have been disabled until the next time the alarm system is armed.

## Steering Column Lock

If equipped, the steering column lock is a theftdeterrent device. This feature locks the steering column when the vehicle is turned off and the driver door is opened, or when the driver door is opened and then the vehicle is turned off. The steering column unlocks when the vehicle is turned on.

The Driver Information Center (DIC) may display one of these messages:

- · A message that the steering column is locked indicates that the engine is running, but the steering column is still locked. It is normal for the column to be locked during a remote start, but the column should
- · A message to service the steering column lock indicates that an issue has been detected with the column lock feature and the vehicle should be serviced.
- unlock after the brake pedal is pressed and the vehicle is started. No message will display during a remote start.
- · A message that the steering wheel must be turned and the vehicle must be started again indicates that the column lock mechanism is bound, the column locking device was unable to unlock the steering column, and the vehicle did not start. If this happens, immediately turn the steering wheel from side to side to unbind the column lock. If this does not unlock the steering column, turn the vehicle off and open the driver door to reset the system. Then turn the vehicle on and immediately turn the steering wheel side to side for about 15 seconds. In some cases, it may take significant force to unbind the column.

To keep the steering column from binding, straighten the front wheels before turning off the vehicle.

## Immobilizer

See Radio Frequency Statement 3 448 .

## Immobilizer Operation

This vehicle has a passive theftdeterrent system.

The system does not have to be manually armed or disarmed.

The vehicle is automatically immobilized when the vehicle is turned off.

The immobilization system is disarmed when the ignition is turned on or to accessory mode and a valid remote key is present in the vehicle.

<!-- image -->

The security light, in the instrument cluster, comes on if there is a problem with arming or disarming the theft-deterrent system.

The system has one or more remote keys matched to an immobilizer control unit in the vehicle. Only a correctly matched remote key will start the vehicle. If the remote key is ever damaged, you may not be able to start your vehicle.

When trying to start the vehicle, the security light may come on briefly.

If the engine does not start and the security light stays on, there is a problem with the system. Turn the ignition off and try again.

If the vehicle will not change ignition modes (accessory mode, on, off), and the remote key appears to be undamaged, try another remote key. Or, you may try placing the remote key in the backup location. See Remote Key Operation 3 7 .

If the ignition modes will not change with the other remote key or in the backup location, the vehicle needs service. If the ignition does change modes, the first remote key may be faulty. See your dealer.

It is possible for the immobilizer system to learn new or replacement remote keys. Up to eight remote keys can be programmed for the vehicle. To program additional remote keys, see 'Programming Remote Keys to the Vehicle' under Remote Key Operation 3 7 .

Do not leave the remote key or device that disarms or deactivates the theft-deterrent system in the vehicle.

## Memory Seats

<!-- image -->

## Overview

If equipped, the memory seat feature allows drivers to save their unique driving positions and a shared exit position. See 'Saving Seating Positions' later in this section. The saved positions can be recalled manually by all drivers, see 'Manually Recalling Seating Positions' later in this section, and drivers with remote key 1 and 2 can also recall them automatically. See 'Auto Seat Entry Memory Recall' or 'Auto Seat Exit Memory Recall' later in this section. To enable automatic recalls, turn on Seat Entry Memory and/or Seat Exit Memory. See 'Enabling Automatic Recalls'

later in this section. The memory recalls may be cancelled at any time during the recall. See 'Cancel Memory Seating Recalls' later in this section.

## Identifying Driver Number

The vehicle identifies the current driver by their remote key number 1-8. The current remote key number may be identified by Driver Information Center (DIC) welcome message, 'You are driver x for memory recalls.' This message is displayed the first few times the vehicle is turned on when a different remote key is used. For Seat Entry Memory to work properly, save positions to the 1 or 2 memory button matching the driver number of this welcome message. To aid in identifying remote key IDs, it is recommended to only carry one remote key when entering the vehicle. Perform the following if the welcome message is not displayed:

- 1. Move all keys and remote keys away from the vehicle.
- 2. Start the vehicle with another remote key. A DIC welcome message should display indicating the driver number of the other
- remote key. Turn the vehicle off and remove the other key or remote key from the vehicle.
- 3. Start the vehicle with the initial key or remote key. The DIC welcome message should display the driver number of the initial remote key.

## Saving Seating Positions

Read these instructions completely before saving memory positions.

To save preferred driving positions to 1 and 2:

- 1. Turn the vehicle on or to accessory mode. A DIC welcome message may indicate the driver number of the current remote key. See 'Identifying Driver Number' previously in this section.
- 2. Adjust all available memory features to the desired driving position.
- 3. Press and release SET; a beep will sound.
- 4. Immediately upon releasing SET, press and hold memory button 1 or 2 matching the current Driver's remote key number until two beeps sound. If too much time passes between releasing SET and pressing 1 or

2, the two beeps will not sound indicating memory position were not saved. Repeat Steps 3 and 4 to try again.

- 5. Repeat Steps 1-4 for the other remote key 1 or 2 using the other 1 or 2 memory button.

It is recommended to save the preferred driving positions to both 1 and 2 if you are the only driver.

To save the common exit seating position to B that is used by all drivers for Manually Recalling Seating Positions and Auto Seat Exit Memory Recall features, repeat Steps 1-4 using B , the exit button.

## Manually Recalling Seating Positions

Press and hold 1, 2, or B button until the recall is complete, to recall the positions previously saved to that button.

Manual Memory recall movement for 1, 2 or B buttons may be initiated and will complete to the saved memory position if the vehicle is in or out of P (Park).

## Enabling Automatic Recalls

- · Seat Entry Memory moves the driver seat to the selected 1 or 2 position when the vehicle is started. Select Settings > Vehicle > Seating Position > Seat Entry Memory > ON or OFF. See 'Auto Seat Entry Memory Recall' later in this section.
- · Seat Exit Memory moves the driver seat to the preferred exit position of the B button when the vehicle is turned off and the door is opened. Select Settings > Vehicle > Seating Position > Seat Exit Memory > Select ON or OFF. See 'Auto Seat Exit Memory Recall' later in this section.

## Auto Seat Entry Memory Recall

Seat Entry Memory will automatically begin movement to the seating positions of the 1 or 2 button corresponding to the driver's remote key number 1 or 2 detected by the vehicle when:

- · Seating positions have been previously saved to the same 1 or 2 button. See 'Saving Seating Positions' previously in this section.
- · The vehicle is turned ON.

- · Seat Entry Memory is enabled. See 'Enabling Automatic Recalls' previously in this section.

Seat Entry Memory Recall will continue if the vehicle is shifted out of P (Park) prior to reaching the saved memory position.

- · The vehicle is in P (Park).

If the saved memory seat position does not automatically recall, verify the recall is enabled. See 'Enabling Automatic Recalls' previously in this section.

If the memory seat recalls to the wrong position, the driver's remote key number 1 or 2 may not match the memory button number positions they were saved to. Try the other remote key or try saving the positions to the other 1 or 2 memory button. See 'Saving Seating Positions' previously in this section.

Automatic Seat Entry Memory recalls are only available for driver's remote key numbers 1 and 2. Remote keys 3-8 will not provide Seat Entry Memory recalls.

## Auto Seat Exit Memory Recall

Seat Exit Memory will begin movement to the seating position of the B button when:

- · The vehicle is turned off and the driver door is open or opened within a short time.
- · A seating position has been previously been saved to the B memory button. See 'Saving Seating Positions' previously in this section.
- · The vehicle is in P (Park).
- · Seat Exit Memory is enabled. See 'Enabling Automatic Recalls' previously in this section.

Seat Exit Memory recall will continue if the vehicle is shifted out of P (Park) prior to reaching the saved memory position.

Seat Exit Memory is not linked to the driver's remote key. The seating position saved to B is used for all drivers.

## Rear Seats

## Rear Seat Reminder

If equipped, the message REAR SEAT REMINDER LOOK IN REAR SEAT displays under certain conditions indicating there may be an item or passenger in the rear seat. Check before exiting the vehicle.

This feature will activate when a second row door is opened while the vehicle is on or up to 10 minutes before the vehicle is turned on. There will be an alert when the vehicle is turned off. The alert does not directly detect objects in the rear seat; instead, under certain conditions, it detects when a rear door is opened and closed, indicating that there may be something in the rear seat.

The feature is active only once each time the vehicle is turned on and off, and will require reactivation by opening and closing the second row doors. There may be an alert even when there is nothing in the rear seat; for example, if a child entered the vehicle through the rear door and left the vehicle without the vehicle being shut off.

The feature can be turned on or off. Select Settings > Vehicle > Rear Seat Reminder > ON or OFF.

## Seat Belts

This section describes how to use seat belts properly, and some things not to do.

<!-- image -->

## Warning

Do not let anyone ride where a seat belt cannot be worn properly. In a crash, if you or your passenger(s) are not wearing seat belts, injuries can be much worse than if you are wearing seat belts. You can be seriously injured or killed by hitting things inside the vehicle harder or by being ejected from the vehicle. In addition, anyone who is not buckled up can strike other passengers in the vehicle.

(Continued)

## Warning (Continued)

It is extremely dangerous to ride in a cargo area, inside or outside of a vehicle. In a collision, passengers riding in these areas are more likely to be seriously injured or killed. Do not allow passengers to ride in any area of the vehicle that is not equipped with seats and seat belts.

Always wear a seat belt, and check that all passenger(s) are restrained properly too.

This vehicle has indicators as a reminder to buckle the seat belts. See Seat Belt Reminders 3 113 .

## Why Seat Belts Work

<!-- image -->

When riding in a vehicle, you travel as fast as the vehicle does. If the vehicle stops suddenly, you keep going until something stops you. It could be the windshield, the instrument panel, or the seat belts!

When you wear a seat belt, you and the vehicle slow down together. There is more time to stop because you stop over a longer distance and, when worn properly, your strongest bones take the forces from the seat belts. That is why wearing seat belts makes such good sense.

## Questions and Answers About Seat Belts

- Q: Will I be trapped in the vehicle after a crash if I am wearing a seat belt?
- A: You could be - whether you are wearing a seat belt or not. Your chance of being conscious during and after a crash, so you can unbuckle and get out, is much greater if you are belted.

<!-- image -->

- Q: If my vehicle has airbags, why should I have to wear seat belts?

<!-- image -->

- A: Airbags are supplemental systems only. They work with seat belts not instead of them. Whether or not an airbag is provided, all occupants still have to buckle up to get the most protection.
- Also, in nearly all states and in all Canadian provinces, the law requires wearing seat belts.

## Buckle To Drive

If equipped, this feature delays the vehicle from shifting out of P (Park) when the driver seat belt is not buckled. The Buckle to Drive feature must be turned ON in the infotainment system to

work. To turn the Buckle to Drive feature on or off, select Settings > Vehicle > Buckle to Drive. See Teen Driver 3 189 , if equipped.

If the vehicle is on and the brake pedal is pressed with the vehicle in P (Park) but the driver seat belt is not buckled, a message displays in the Driver Information Center (DIC) and the vehicle will be delayed from shifting out of P (Park). Buckle the driver seat belt to clear the message and shift out of P (Park). Shifting from P (Park) will be delayed once for each time the vehicle is started.

For some fleet vehicles, the feature is always ON and cannot be turned OFF in the infotainment system. The vehicle will be delayed from shifting from P (Park) each time the driver attempts to do so while the driver seat belt is not buckled. Turning the vehicle off then on will not change this condition.

On some models, Buckle to Drive may also delay shifting out of P (Park) if a front passenger seat belt is unbuckled. A message displays in the DIC. Buckle the front passenger seat belt to shift out of P (Park). This feature may delay the vehicle from shifting out of P (Park) if an object, such as a briefcase, handbag, grocery bag, laptop, or other electronic device,

is on the front passenger seat. If this happens, remove the object from the seat or buckle the seat belt to shift out of P (Park).

If the driver, or on some vehicles, the present front passenger remains unbuckled, the DIC message will turn off after several seconds and the vehicle can be shifted out of P (Park). See 'Seat Belts' and 'Child Restraints' in the Index for information about the importance of proper restraint use.

If the driver seat belt or the front passenger seat belt is unbuckled when driving, the seat belt reminder chime and light(s) will come on. See Seat Belt Reminders 3 113 . This feature may not function properly if the airbag readiness light is on. See Airbag Readiness Light 3 114 .

## How to Wear Seat Belts Properly

Follow these rules for everyone's protection.

There are additional things to know about seat belts and children, including smaller children and infants. If a child will be riding in the vehicle, see Older Children 3 74 or Infants and Young Children 3 76 . Review and follow the rules for children in addition to the following rules.

It is very important for all occupants to buckle up. Statistics show that unbelted people are hurt more often in crashes than those who are wearing seat belts.

There are important things to know about wearing a seat belt properly.

<!-- image -->

- · Sit up straight and always keep your feet on the floor in front of you (if possible).
- · Wear the lap part of the belt low and snug on the hips, just touching the thighs. In a crash, this applies force to the strong pelvic bones and you would be less likely to slide under the lap belt. If you slid under it, the belt would apply force on your abdomen. This could cause serious or even fatal injuries.

- · Wear the shoulder belt over the shoulder and across the chest. These parts of the body are best able to take belt restraining forces. The shoulder belt locks if there is a sudden stop or crash.

<!-- image -->

## Warning

You can be seriously injured, or even killed, by not wearing your seat belt properly.

<!-- image -->

Never allow the lap or shoulder belt to become loose or twisted.

<!-- image -->

Never wear the shoulder belt under both arms or behind your back.

<!-- image -->

Always use the correct buckle for your seating position.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Never route the lap or shoulder belt over an armrest.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## Warning

The seat belt can be pinched if it is routed under plastic trim on the seat, such as trim around the rear seatback folding handle or side airbag. In a crash, pinched seat belts might not provide adequate protection. Never allow seat belts to be routed under plastic trim pieces.

<!-- image -->

## Warning

You can be seriously injured or killed if the shoulder belt is worn behind your back, under your legs, or wrapped around your neck. The shoulder belt can tighten but cannot be loosened if it is locked. The shoulder belt locks when it is pulled all the way out of the retractor. It unlocks when the shoulder belt is allowed to go all the way back into the retractor, but it cannot do this if it is wrapped around you. You may have to cut the seat belt if it is locked and tightened around you.

## Lap-Shoulder Belt

All seating positions in the vehicle have a lapshoulder belt.

If you are using a rear seating position with a detachable seat belt and the seat belt is not attached, see Third Row Seats 3 53 for instructions on reconnecting the seat belt to the mini-buckle.

The following instructions explain how to wear a lap-shoulder belt properly.

- 1. Adjust the seat, if the seat is adjustable, so you can sit up straight. To see how, see 'Seats' in the Index.

<!-- image -->

- 2. Pick up the latch plate and pull the belt across you. Do not let it get twisted.
- The lap-shoulder belt may lock if you pull the belt across you very quickly. If this happens, let the belt go back slightly to unlock it. Then pull the belt across you more slowly.

If the shoulder portion of a passenger belt is pulled out all the way, the child restraint locking feature may be engaged. See Child Restraint Systems 3 78 . If this occurs, let the belt go back all the way and start again.

If the locking feature stays engaged after letting the belt go back to stowed position on the seat, move the seat rearward or recline the seat until the shoulder belt retractor lock releases.

Engaging the child restraint locking feature in the front outboard seating position may affect the passenger sensing system. See Passenger Sensing System 3 69 .

<!-- image -->

- 3. Push the latch plate into the buckle until it clicks.
- If the latch plate will not go fully into the buckle, check if the correct buckle is being used.

Pull up on the latch plate to make sure it is secure.

If the belt is not long enough, see Seat Belt Extender 3 62 .

- Position the release pushbutton on the buckle so that the seat belt could be quickly unbuckled if necessary.
- 4. If equipped with a shoulder belt height adjuster, move it to the height that is right for you. See 'Shoulder Belt Height Adjuster' in this section for instructions on use and important safety information.

<!-- image -->

- 5. To make the lap part tight, pull up on the shoulder belt.

<!-- image -->

To unlatch the belt, push the release pushbutton on the buckle. The belt should return to its stowed position.

Always stow the seat belt slowly. If the seat belt webbing returns quickly to the stowed position, the retractor may lock and cannot be pulled out. If this happens, pull the seat belt straight out firmly to unlock the webbing, and then release it. If the webbing is still locked in the retractor, see your dealer.

Before a door is closed, be sure the seat belt is out of the way. If a door is slammed against a seat belt, damage can occur to both the seat belt and the vehicle.

## Shoulder Belt Height Adjuster

The vehicle has a shoulder belt height adjuster for the driver and front outboard passenger positions.

Adjust the height so the shoulder portion of the belt is on the shoulder and not falling off of it. The belt should be close to, but not contacting, the neck. Improper shoulder belt height adjustment could reduce the effectiveness of the seat belt in a crash. See How to Wear Seat Belts Properly 3 57 .

Push the release button to move the height adjuster to the desired position.

<!-- image -->

After the adjuster is set to the desired position, try to move it down without pushing the release button to make sure it has locked into position.

## Automatic Seat Belt Tightening System

The vehicle may have the Automatic Seat Belt Tightening System.

Each time the front seat belts are buckled while the vehicle is in P (Park) or D (Drive) and the engine is running or in Auto Stop (if equipped), the system may activate to tighten the seat belts.

The system also activates during emergency braking and/or sudden driving maneuvers and releases when driving conditions return to normal.

The system will not activate if the Traction Control/Electronic Stability Control system is not functioning properly. See Traction Control/ Electronic Stability Control 3 242 . If there is a problem with the Automatic Seat Belt Tightening System, a message displays on the Driver Information Center (DIC). If a system unavailable message displays repeatedly or if a service message displays, see your dealer. Other seat belt functions are not affected by the Automatic Seat Belt Tightening System.

## Seat Belt Pretensioners

This vehicle has seat belt pretensioners for the front outboard occupants.

Although the seat belt pretensioners cannot be seen, they are part of the seat belt assembly. They can help tighten the seat belts during the early stages of a moderate to severe frontal or near frontal crash if the threshold conditions for pretensioner activation are met.

Seat belt pretensioners can also help tighten the seat belts in a side crash or rollover event.

Pretensioners work only once. If the pretensioners activate in a crash, the pretensioners and probably other parts of the vehicle seat belt system will need to be replaced. See Replacing Seat Belt System Parts after a Crash 3 63 .

Do not sit on the outboard seat belt while entering or exiting the vehicle or at any time while sitting in the seat. Sitting on the seat belt can damage the webbing and hardware.

## Rear Seat Belt Comfort Guides

Rear seat belt comfort guides may provide added seat belt comfort for older children who have outgrown booster seats and for some

adults. When installed on a shoulder belt, the comfort guide positions the shoulder belt away from the neck and head.

Comfort guides are available through your dealer for the rear outboard seating positions. Instructions are included with the comfort guides.

## Seat Belt Use During Pregnancy

Seat belts work for everyone, including pregnant women. Like all occupants, they are more likely to be seriously injured if they do not wear seat belts.

<!-- image -->

A pregnant woman should wear a lap-shoulder belt, and the lap portion should be worn as low as possible, below the rounding, throughout the pregnancy.

The best way to protect the fetus is to protect the mother. When a seat belt is worn properly, it is more likely that the fetus will not be hurt in a crash. For pregnant women, as for anyone, the key to making seat belts effective is wearing them properly.

## Seat Belt Extender

If the vehicle seat belt will fasten around you, you should use it.

But if a seat belt is not long enough, your dealer will order you an extender. Only a GM dealer issued extender should be used. When you go in to order it, take the heaviest coat you will wear, so the extender will be long enough for you. To help avoid personal injury, do not let someone else use it, and use it only for the seat it is made to fit. The extender has been designed for adults. Never use it for securing child restraints. For more information on the proper use and fit of seat belt extenders see the instruction sheet that comes with the extender.

## Safety System Check

Periodically check the seat belt reminder, seat belts, buckles, latch plates, retractors, shoulder belt height adjusters (if equipped), and seat belt anchorages to make sure they are all in working order. Look for any other loose or damaged seat belt system parts that might keep a seat belt system from performing properly. See your dealer to have it repaired. Torn, frayed, or twisted seat belts may not protect you in a crash. Torn or frayed seat belts can rip apart under impact forces. If a belt is torn or frayed, have it replaced immediately. If a belt is twisted, it may be possible to untwist by reversing the latch plate on the webbing. If the twist cannot be corrected, ask your dealer to fix it.

Make sure the seat belt reminder light is working. See Seat Belt Reminders 3 113 .

Keep seat belts clean and dry. See Seat Belt Care 3 62 .

## Seat Belt Care

Keep belts clean and dry. Seat belts should be properly cared for and maintained.

Seat Belt hardware should be kept dry and free of dust or debris. As necessary exterior hard surfaces and seat belt webbing may be lightly cleaned with mild soap and water. Ensure there is not excessive dust or debris in the mechanism. If dust or debris exists in the system after proper cleaning please see the dealer. Parts may need to be replaced to ensure proper functionality of the system.

<!-- image -->

## Warning

Do not bleach or dye seat belt webbing. It may severely weaken the webbing. In a crash, they might not be able to provide adequate protection. Clean and rinse seat belt webbing only with mild soap and lukewarm water. Allow the webbing to dry.

## Replacing Seat Belt System Parts after a Crash

<!-- image -->

## Warning

A crash can damage the seat belt system in the vehicle. A damaged seat belt system may not properly protect the person using it, resulting in serious injury or even death in a crash. To help make sure the seat belt systems are working properly after a crash, have them inspected and any necessary replacements made as soon as possible.

After a minor crash, replacement of seat belts may not be necessary. But the seat belt assemblies that were used during any crash may have been stressed or damaged. See your dealer to have the seat belt assemblies inspected or replaced.

New parts and repairs may be necessary even if the seat belt system was not being used at the time of the crash.

Have the seat belt pretensioners checked if the vehicle has been in a crash, or if the airbag readiness light stays on after you start the vehicle or while you are driving. See Airbag Readiness Light 3 114 .

## Airbag System

The vehicle has the following airbags:

- · A frontal airbag for the front outboard passenger
- · A frontal airbag for the driver
- · A front center airbag for the driver and front outboard passenger
- · A seat-mounted side impact airbag for the front outboard passenger
- · A seat-mounted side impact airbag for the driver
- · A roof-rail airbag for the driver and for the second and third row passengers seated directly behind the driver
- · A roof-rail airbag for the front outboard passenger and the second and third row passengers seated directly behind the front outboard passenger

All vehicle airbags have the word AIRBAG on the

center of the steering wheel for the driver and on the instrument panel for the front outboard passenger.

trim or on a label near the deployment opening. For frontal airbags, the word AIRBAG is on the

For the front center airbag, the word AIRBAG is on the inboard side of the driver seatback.

For seat-mounted side impact airbags, the word AIRBAG is on the side of the seatback or side of the seat closest to the door.

For roof-rail airbags, the word AIRBAG is on the ceiling or trim.

Airbags are designed to supplement the protection provided by seat belts. Even though today's airbags are also designed to help reduce the risk of injury from the force of an inflating bag, all airbags must inflate very quickly to do their job.

Here are the most important things to know about the airbag system:

<!-- image -->

## Warning

You can be severely injured or killed in a crash if you are not wearing your seat belt, even with airbags. Airbags are designed to work with seat belts, not replace them. Also, airbags are not designed to inflate in every crash. In some crashes seat belts are the only restraint. See When Should an Airbag Inflate? 3 66 .

Wearing your seat belt during a crash helps reduce your chance of hitting things inside the vehicle or being ejected from it. Airbags are 'supplemental restraints' to the seat belts. Everyone in the vehicle should wear a seat belt properly, whether or not there is an airbag for that person.

<!-- image -->

## Warning

Because airbags inflate with great force and faster than the blink of an eye, anyone who is up against, or very close to any airbag when it inflates can be seriously injured or killed. Do not sit unnecessarily close to any (Continued)

## Warning (Continued)

airbag, as you would be if sitting on the edge of the seat or leaning forward. Seat belts help keep you in position before and during a crash. Always wear a seat belt, even with airbags. The driver should sit as far back as possible while still maintaining control of the vehicle. The seat belts and the front outboard passenger airbags are most effective when you are sitting well back and upright in the seat with both feet on the floor.

Occupants should not lean on or sleep against the front center armrest or console in vehicles with a front center airbag.

Occupants should not lean on or sleep against the door or side windows in seating positions with seat-mounted side impact airbags and/or roof-rail airbags.

<!-- image -->

## Warning

Children who are up against, or very close to, any airbag when it inflates can be seriously injured or killed. Always secure children properly in the vehicle. To read how, see Older Children 3 74 or Infants and Young Children 3 76 .

<!-- image -->

There is an airbag readiness light on the center stack below the infotainment screen, which shows the airbag symbol.

The system checks the airbag electrical system for malfunctions. The light tells you if there is an electrical problem. See Airbag Readiness Light 3 114 .

## Where Are the Airbags?

## Warning

If something is between an occupant and an airbag, the airbag might not inflate properly or it might force the object into that person causing severe injury or even death. The path of an inflating airbag must be kept clear. Do not put anything

(Continued)

## Warning (Continued)

between an occupant and an airbag, and do not attach or put anything on the steering wheel hub or on or near any other airbag covering.

Do not use seat or console accessories that block the inflation path of a seatmounted side impact airbag or the front center airbag.

Never secure anything to the roof of a vehicle with roof-rail airbags by routing a rope or tie-down through any door or window opening. If you do, the path of an inflating roof-rail airbag will be blocked.

## When Should an Airbag Inflate?

This vehicle is equipped with airbags. See Airbag System 3 63 . Airbags are designed to inflate if the impact exceeds the specific airbag system's deployment threshold. Deployment thresholds are used to predict how severe a crash is likely to be in time for the airbags to inflate and help restrain the occupants. The vehicle has electronic sensors that help the

airbag system determine the severity of the impact. Deployment thresholds can vary with specific vehicle design.

Frontal airbags are designed to inflate in moderate to severe frontal crashes to help reduce the potential for severe injuries, mainly to the driver's or front outboard passenger's head and chest.

Whether the frontal airbags will or should inflate is not based primarily on how fast the vehicle is traveling. It depends on what is hit, the direction of the impact, and how quickly the vehicle slows down.

Frontal airbags may inflate at different crash speeds depending on whether the vehicle hits an object straight on or at an angle, and whether the object is fixed or moving, rigid or deformable, narrow or wide.

Frontal airbags are not intended to inflate during vehicle rollovers, rear impacts, or many side impacts.

In addition, the vehicle has advanced technology frontal airbags. Advanced technology frontal airbags adjust the restraint according to either crash severity or occupant interaction.

The front center airbag is designed to inflate in moderate to severe side crashes depending upon the location of the impact, when either side of the vehicle is struck. In addition, the front center airbag is designed to inflate when the sensing system predicts that the vehicle is about to roll over on its side. The front center airbag is not designed to inflate in frontal impacts, near frontal impacts, or rear impacts.

Seat-mounted side impact airbags are designed to inflate in moderate to severe side crashes depending on the location of the impact. These airbags may also inflate in some moderate to severe frontal impacts. Seat-mounted side impact airbags are not designed to inflate in rollovers or rear impacts. A seat-mounted side impact airbag is designed to inflate on the side of the vehicle that is struck.

Roof-rail airbags are designed to inflate in moderate to severe side crashes depending on the location of the impact. In addition, these roof-rail airbags may inflate during a rollover or in a severe frontal impact. Roof-rail airbags are not designed to inflate in rear impacts. Both roof-rail airbags may inflate when either side of the vehicle is struck or if the sensing system predicts that the vehicle is about to roll over on its side, or in a severe frontal impact.

In any particular crash, no one can say whether an airbag should have inflated simply because of the vehicle damage or the repair costs.

## What Makes an Airbag Inflate?

In a deployment event, the sensing system sends an electrical signal triggering a release of gas from the inflator. Gas from the inflator fills the airbag causing the bag to break out of the cover. The inflator, the airbag, and related hardware are all part of the airbag module.

For airbag locations, see Where Are the Airbags? 3 65 .

## How Does an Airbag Restrain?

In moderate to severe frontal collisions, even belted occupants can contact the steering wheel or the instrument panel. In moderate to severe side collisions, even belted occupants can contact the inside of the vehicle.

Airbags supplement the protection provided by seat belts by distributing the force of the impact more evenly over the occupant's body. Rollover capable roof-rail airbags are designed to help contain the head and chest of occupants in the outboard seating positions in the first, second, and third rows. The rollover capable

roof-rail airbags are designed to help reduce the risk of full or partial ejection in rollover events, although no system can prevent all such ejections.

But airbags would not help in many types of collisions, primarily because the occupant's motion is not toward those airbags. See When Should an Airbag Inflate? 3 66 .

Airbags should never be regarded as anything more than a supplement to seat belts.

## What Will You See after an Airbag Inflates?

After frontal and seat-mounted side impact airbags inflate, they quickly deflate, so quickly that some people may not even realize the airbags inflated. The front center airbag and roof-rail airbags may still be at least partially inflated for some time after they inflate. Some components of the airbag module may be hot for several minutes. For location of the airbags, see Where Are the Airbags? 3 65 .

The parts of the airbag that come into contact with you may be warm, but not too hot to touch. There may be some smoke and dust

coming from the vents in the deflated airbags. Airbag inflation does not prevent people from leaving the vehicle.

## Warning

When an airbag inflates, there may be dust in the air. This dust could cause breathing problems for people with a history of asthma or other breathing trouble. To avoid this, everyone in the vehicle should get out as soon as it is safe to do so. If you have breathing problems but cannot get out of the vehicle after an airbag inflates, then get fresh air by opening a window or a door. If you experience breathing problems following an airbag deployment, you should seek medical attention.

The vehicle has a feature that may automatically unlock the doors, turn on the interior lamps and hazard warning flashers, and shut off the fuel system after the airbags inflate. The feature may also activate, without airbag inflation, after an event that exceeds a predetermined threshold. After turning the vehicle off and then on again, the fuel system will return to normal operation; the doors can be locked, the interior lamps can be turned off,

and the hazard warning flashers can be turned off using the controls for those features. If any of these systems are damaged in the crash they may not operate as normal.

## Warning

A crash severe enough to inflate the airbags may have also damaged important functions in the vehicle, such as the fuel system, brake and steering systems, etc. Even if the vehicle appears to be drivable after a moderate crash, there may be concealed damage that could make it difficult to safely operate the vehicle.

Use caution if you should attempt to restart the engine after a crash has occurred.

In many crashes severe enough to inflate the airbag, windshields are broken by vehicle deformation. Additional windshield breakage may also occur from the front outboard passenger airbag.

- · Airbags are designed to inflate only once. After an airbag inflates, you will need some new parts for the airbag system. If you do not get them, the airbag system will not be there to help protect you in another crash. A new system will include airbag modules and possibly other parts. The service manual for the vehicle covers the need to replace other parts.
- · Let only qualified technicians work on the airbag system. Improper service can mean that an airbag system will not work properly. See your dealer for service.
- · The vehicle has a crash sensing and diagnostic module which records information after a crash. See Vehicle Data Recording and Privacy 3 449 and Event Data Recorders 3 450 .

## Passenger Sensing System

The vehicle has a passenger sensing system for the front outboard passenger position. The passenger airbag status indicator will light on the overhead console when the vehicle is started.

## United States and Canada

The words ON and OFF, and the symbols for on and off, will be visible during the system check. When the system check is complete, either the word ON or OFF, and the symbol for on or off, will be visible. See Passenger Airbag Status Indicator 3 115 .

The passenger sensing system turns off the front outboard passenger frontal airbag under certain conditions. No other airbag is affected by the passenger sensing system.

The passenger sensing system works with sensors that are part of the front outboard passenger seat and seat belt. The sensors are designed to detect the presence of a properly seated occupant and determine if the front outboard passenger frontal airbag should be allowed to inflate or not.

According to accident statistics, children are safer when properly secured in a rear seat in the correct child restraint for their weight and size.

Whenever possible, children aged 12 and under should be secured in a rear seating position.

Never put a rear-facing child seat in the front. This is because the risk to the rear-facing child is so great, if the airbag inflates.

<!-- image -->

## Warning

A child in a rear-facing child restraint can be seriously injured or killed if the passenger frontal airbag inflates. This is because the back of the rear-facing child restraint would be very close to the inflating airbag. A child in a forward-facing child restraint can be seriously injured or killed if the passenger frontal airbag inflates and the passenger seat is in a forward position.

Even if the passenger sensing system has turned off the passenger frontal airbag, no system is fail-safe. No one can guarantee that an airbag will not deploy under some unusual circumstance, even though the airbag is turned off.

Never put a rear-facing child restraint in the front seat, even if the airbag is off. If securing a forward-facing child restraint in

(Continued)

## Warning (Continued)

the front outboard passenger seat, always move the seat as far back as it will go. It is better to secure child restraints in the rear seat. Consider using another vehicle to transport the child when a rear seat is not available.

If the vehicle does not have a rear seat that will accommodate a rear-facing child restraint, a rear-facing child restraint should not be installed in the vehicle, even if the airbag is off.

The passenger sensing system is designed to turn off the front outboard passenger frontal airbag if:

- · The system determines an infant is present in a child restraint.
- · The front outboard passenger seat is unoccupied.
- · A front outboard passenger takes his/her weight off of the seat for a period of time.

When the passenger sensing system has turned off the front outboard passenger frontal airbag, the OFF indicator will light and stay lit as a reminder that the airbag is off. See Passenger Airbag Status Indicator 3 115 .

The passenger sensing system is designed to turn on the front outboard passenger frontal airbag anytime the system senses that a person of adult size is sitting properly in the front outboard passenger seat.

When the passenger sensing system has allowed the airbag to be enabled, the ON indicator will light and stay lit as a reminder that the airbag is active.

For some children, including children in child restraints, and for very small adults, the passenger sensing system may or may not turn off the front outboard passenger frontal airbag, depending upon the person's seating posture and body build. Everyone in the vehicle who has outgrown child restraints should wear a seat belt properly - whether or not there is an airbag for that person.

<!-- image -->

## Warning

If the airbag readiness light ever comes on and stays on, it means that something may be wrong with the airbag system. To help avoid injury to yourself or others, have the vehicle serviced right away. See Airbag Readiness Light 3 114 for more information, including important safety information.

## If the On Indicator Is Lit for a Child Restraint

The passenger sensing system is designed to turn off the front outboard passenger frontal airbag if the system determines that an infant is present in a child restraint. If a child restraint has been installed and the ON indicator is lit:

- 1. Turn the vehicle off.
- 2. Remove the child restraint from the vehicle.
- 3. Remove any additional items from the seat such as blankets, cushions, seat covers, seat heaters, or seat massagers.
- 4. Reinstall the child restraint following the directions provided by the child restraint manufacturer and refer to Securing Child Restraints (With the Seat Belt in the Rear

Seat) 3 88 Securing Child Restraints (With the Seat Belt in the Front Passenger Seat) 3 90 .

Make sure the seat belt retractor is locked by pulling the shoulder belt all the way out of the retractor when installing the child restraint, even if the child restraint is equipped with a seat belt lock off. When the retractor lock is set, the belt can be tightened but not pulled out of the retractor.

- 5. If, after reinstalling the child restraint and restarting the vehicle, the ON indicator is still lit, turn the vehicle off. Then slightly recline the vehicle seatback and adjust the seat cushion, if adjustable, to make sure that the vehicle seatback is not pushing the child restraint into the seat cushion.
- Also make sure the child restraint is not trapped under the vehicle head restraint. If this happens, adjust the head restraint. See Head Restraints 3 39 .
- 6. Restart the vehicle.

The passenger sensing system may or may not turn off the airbag for a child in a child restraint depending upon the child's size. It is better to secure child restraints in a rear seat. Consider

using another vehicle to transport the child when a rear seat is not available. Never put a rear-facing child restraint in the front seat, even if the ON indicator is not lit.

## If the Off Indicator Is Lit for an AdultSized Occupant

<!-- image -->

If a person of adult size is sitting in the front outboard passenger seat, but the OFF indicator is lit, it could be because that person is not sitting properly in the seat or that the child restraint locking feature is engaged. Use the following steps to allow the system to detect that person and enable the front outboard passenger frontal airbag:

- 1. Turn the vehicle off.

- 2. Remove any additional material from the seat, such as blankets, cushions, seat covers, seat heaters, or seat massagers.
- 3. Place the seatback in the fully upright position.
- 4. Have the person sit upright in the seat, centered on the seat cushion, with legs comfortably extended.
- 5. If the shoulder portion of the belt is pulled out all the way, the child restraint locking feature will be engaged. This may unintentionally cause the passenger sensing system to turn the airbag off for some adult-sized occupants. If this happens, unbuckle the belt, let the belt go back all the way, and then buckle the belt again without pulling the belt out all the way.
- 6. Restart the vehicle and have the person remain in this position for two to three minutes after the ON indicator is lit.

<!-- image -->

## Warning

If the front outboard passenger airbag is turned off for an adult-sized occupant, the airbag will not be able to inflate and help protect that person in a crash, resulting in an increased risk of serious injury or even death. An adult-sized occupant should not ride in the front outboard passenger seat, if the passenger airbag OFF indicator is lit.

## Additional Factors Affecting System Operation

Seat belts help keep the passenger in position on the seat during vehicle maneuvers and braking, which helps the passenger sensing system maintain the passenger airbag status. See 'Seat Belts' and 'Child Restraints' in the Index for additional information about the importance of proper restraint use.

A thick layer of additional material, such as a blanket or cushion, or aftermarket equipment such as seat covers, seat heaters, and seat massagers can affect how well the passenger sensing system operates. We recommend that you not use seat covers or other aftermarket equipment except when approved by GM for

your specific vehicle. See Adding Equipment to the Airbag-Equipped Vehicle 3 72 for more information about modifications that can affect how the system operates.

The ON indicator may be lit if an object, such as a briefcase, handbag, grocery bag, laptop, or other electronic device, is put on an unoccupied seat. If this is not desired, remove the object from the seat.

<!-- image -->

## Warning

Stowing articles under the passenger seat or between the passenger seat cushion and seatback may interfere with the proper operation of the passenger sensing system.

## Servicing the Airbag-Equipped Vehicle

Airbags affect how the vehicle should be serviced. There are parts of the airbag system in several places around the vehicle. Your dealer and the service manual have information about servicing the vehicle and the airbag system. To purchase a service manual, see Publication Ordering Information 3 448 .

<!-- image -->

## Warning

For up to 10 seconds after the vehicle is turned off and the battery is disconnected, an airbag can still inflate during improper service. You can be injured if you are close to an airbag when it inflates. Avoid yellow connectors. They are probably part of the airbag system. Be sure to follow proper service procedures, and make sure the person performing work for you is qualified to do so.

## Adding Equipment to the AirbagEquipped Vehicle

Adding accessories that change the vehicle's frame, bumper system, height, front end, or side sheet metal may keep the airbag system from working properly.

The operation of the airbag system can also be affected by changing, including improperly repairing or replacing, any parts of the following:

- · Front seats, including stitching, seams or zippers
- · Airbag system, including airbag modules, front or side impact sensors, sensing and diagnostic module, airbag wiring, or front center console
- · Seat belts
- · Inner door seals, including speakers
- · Steering wheel, instrument panel, overhead console, ceiling trim, or pillar garnish trim

Your dealer and the service manual have information about the location of the airbag modules and sensors, sensing and diagnostic module, and airbag wiring along with the proper replacement procedures.

In addition, the vehicle has a passenger sensing system for the front outboard passenger position, which includes sensors that are part of the passenger's seat. The passenger sensing system may not operate properly if the original seat trim is replaced with non-GM

covers, upholstery, or trim, or with GM covers, upholstery, or trim designed for a different vehicle. Any object, such as an aftermarket seat heater or a comfort enhancing pad or device, installed under or on top of the seat fabric, could also interfere with the operation of the passenger sensing system. This could either prevent proper deployment of the passenger airbag(s) or prevent the passenger sensing system from properly turning off the passenger airbag(s). See Passenger Sensing System 3 69 .

If the vehicle has rollover roof-rail airbags, see Different Size Tires and Wheels 3 393 for additional important information.

If the vehicle must be modified because you have a disability and you have questions about whether the modifications will affect the vehicle's airbag system, or if you have questions about whether the airbag system will be affected if the vehicle is modified for any other reason, call Customer Assistance. See Customer Assistance Offices 3 442 .

## Airbag System Check

The airbag system does not need regularly scheduled maintenance or replacement. Make sure the airbag readiness light is working. See Airbag Readiness Light 3 114 .

## Caution

If an airbag covering is damaged, opened, or broken, the airbag may not work properly. Do not open or break the airbag coverings. If there are any opened or broken airbag coverings, have the airbag covering and/or airbag module replaced. For the location of the airbags, see Where Are the Airbags? 3 65 . See your dealer for service.

## Replacing Airbag System Parts after a Crash

<!-- image -->

## Warning

A crash can damage the airbag systems in the vehicle. A damaged airbag system may not properly protect you and your

(Continued)

## Warning (Continued)

passenger(s) in a crash, resulting in serious injury or even death. To help make sure the airbag systems are working properly after a crash, have them inspected and any necessary replacements made as soon as possible.

If an airbag inflates, you will need to replace airbag system parts. See your dealer for service.

If the airbag readiness light stays on after the vehicle is started or comes on when you are driving, the airbag system may not work properly. Have the vehicle serviced right away. See Airbag Readiness Light 3 114 .

## Child Restraints Older Children

<!-- image -->

Older children who have outgrown booster seats should wear the vehicle seat belts. Refer to How to Wear Seat Belts Properly 3 57 .

The manufacturer instructions that come with the booster seat state the weight and height limitations for that booster. Use a booster seat with a lap-shoulder belt until the child passes the fit test below:

- · Sit all the way back on the seat. Do the knees bend at the seat edge? If yes, continue. If no, return to the booster seat.
- · Buckle the lap-shoulder belt. Does the shoulder belt rest on the shoulder? If yes, continue. If no, try using the rear seat belt comfort guide, if available. See 'Rear Seat Belt Comfort Guides' under Lap-Shoulder Belt 3 59 . If a comfort guide is not available, or if the shoulder belt still does not rest on the shoulder, then return to the booster seat.
- · Can proper seat belt fit be maintained for the length of the trip? If yes, continue. If no, return to the booster seat.
- · Does the lap belt fit low and snug on the hips, touching the thighs? If yes, continue. If no, return to the booster seat.

## Q: What is the proper way to wear seat belts?

- A: An older child should wear a lapshoulder belt and get the additional restraint a shoulder belt can provide. The shoulder belt should not cross the face or neck. The lap belt should fit snugly below the hips, just touching the top of the thighs. This applies belt force to the child's pelvic bones in a crash. It should never be worn over the abdomen, which could cause severe or even fatal internal injuries in a crash.

Also see 'Rear Seat Belt Comfort Guides' under Lap-Shoulder Belt 3 59 .

According to accident statistics, children are safer when properly restrained in a rear seating position.

In a crash, children who are not buckled up can strike other people who are buckled up, or can be thrown out of the vehicle. Older children need to use seat belts properly.

<!-- image -->

## Warning

Never allow more than one child to wear the same seat belt. The seat belt cannot properly spread the impact forces. In a crash, they can be crushed together and seriously injured. A seat belt must be used by only one person at a time.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## Warning

Never allow a child to wear the seat belt shoulder belt under both arms or behind their back. A child can be seriously injured by not wearing the lap-shoulder belt properly. In a crash, the child would not be restrained by the shoulder belt. The child could move too far forward increasing the chance of head and neck injury. The child might also slide under the lap belt. The belt force would then be applied right on the abdomen. That could cause serious or fatal injuries. The shoulder belt should go over the shoulder and across the chest.

<!-- image -->

## Infants and Young Children

Everyone in a vehicle needs protection! This includes infants and all other children. Neither the distance traveled nor the age and size of the traveler changes the need, for everyone, to use safety restraints. In fact, the law in every state in the United States and in every Canadian province says children up to some age must be restrained while in a vehicle.

<!-- image -->

## Warning

Children can be seriously injured or killed if the shoulder belt is worn behind their back, under their legs, or wrapped around their neck. The shoulder belt can tighten but cannot be loosened if it is locked. The shoulder belt locks when it is pulled all the way out of the retractor. It unlocks when the shoulder belt is allowed to go all the way back into the retractor, but it cannot do this if it is wrapped around the child. Never leave children unattended in a vehicle and never allow children to improperly wear, or play with, the seat belts.

Every time infants and young children ride in vehicles, they should have the protection provided by appropriate child restraints. Neither the vehicle seat belt system nor its airbag system is designed for them.

Children who are not restrained properly can strike other people, or can be thrown out of the vehicle.

<!-- image -->

## Warning

Never hold an infant or a child while riding in a vehicle. Due to crash forces, an infant or a child will become so heavy it is not possible to hold it during a crash. For example, in a crash at only 40 km/h (25 mph), a 5.5 kg (12 lb) infant will suddenly become a 110 kg (240 lb) force on a person's arms. An infant or child should be secured in an appropriate child restraint.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## Warning

Children who are up against, or very close to, any airbag when it inflates can be seriously injured or killed. Never put a rearfacing child restraint in the front passenger seat. Secure a rear-facing child restraint in a rear seat.

It is also better to secure a forward-facing child restraint in a rear seat. If a forwardfacing child restraint must be secured in the front passenger seat, always move the front passenger seat as far back as it will go.

(Continued)

## Warning (Continued)

If a child restraint is installed in the second row center seat, move the second row seat to the rearward position, whenever possible, to minimize contact with the front center airbag.

<!-- image -->

Child restraints are devices used to restrain, seat, or position children in the vehicle and are sometimes called child seats or car seats.

## There are three basic types of child restraints:

- · Rear-facing child restraints
- · Forward-facing child restraints
- · Belt-positioning booster seats

The proper child restraint for your child depends on their size, weight, and age, and also on whether the child restraint is compatible with the vehicle in which it will be used.

For each type of child restraint, there are many different models available. When purchasing a child restraint, be sure it is designed to be used in a motor vehicle and is designed by a genuine child restraint manufacturer. If it is, the child restraint will have a label saying that it meets federal motor vehicle safety standards.

The instruction manual that is provided with the child restraint states the weight and height limitations for that particular child restraint. In addition, there are many kinds of child restraints available for children with special needs.

<!-- image -->

## Warning

To reduce the risk of neck and head injury in a crash, infants and toddlers should be secured in a rear-facing child restraint until age two, or until they reach the maximum height and weight limits of their child restraint.

<!-- image -->

## Warning

A young child's hip bones are still so small that the vehicle seat belt may not remain low on the hip bones, as it should. Instead, it may settle up around the child's abdomen. In a crash, the belt would apply force on a body area that is unprotected by any bony structure. This alone could cause serious or fatal injuries. To reduce the risk of serious or fatal injuries during a crash, young children should always be secured in an appropriate child restraint.

## Child Restraint Systems

Rear-Facing Infant Restraint

<!-- image -->

A rear-facing child restraint provides restraint with the seating surface against the back of the infant.

The harness system holds the infant in place and, in a crash, acts to keep the infant positioned in the restraint.

<!-- image -->

Forward-Facing Child Restraint

<!-- image -->

A forward-facing child restraint provides restraint for the child's body with the harness.

Booster Seats

A belt-positioning booster seat is used for children who have outgrown their forwardfacing child restraint. Boosters are designed to improve the fit of the vehicle seat belt system until the child is large enough for the vehicle seat belts to fit properly without a booster seat. See the seat belt fit test in Older Children 3 74 .

## Securing an Add-On Child Restraint in the Vehicle

<!-- image -->

## Warning

A child can be seriously injured or killed in a crash if the child restraint is not properly secured in the vehicle. Secure the child restraint properly in the vehicle using the vehicle seat belt or LATCH system, following the instructions that came with that child restraint and the instructions in this manual.

To help reduce the chance of injury, the child restraint must be secured in the vehicle. Child restraints must be secured in vehicle seats by the lap belt portion of a lap-shoulder belt, or by the LATCH system. See Lower Anchors and Tethers for Children (LATCH System) 3 81 for more information. Never use a seat belt extender when installing a child restraint. Never use non-regulated aftermarket anchors or attachments to secure a child restraint. Children can be endangered in a crash if the child restraint is not properly secured in the vehicle.

When securing an add-on child restraint, refer to the following:

- · Instruction manual provided with the child restraint
- · Instruction labels provided on the child restraint
- · This vehicle owner's manual

The child restraint instructions are important, so if they are not available, obtain a replacement copy from the manufacturer.

Keep in mind that an unsecured child restraint can move around in a collision or sudden stop and injure people in the vehicle. Be sure to properly secure any child restraint in the vehicle - even when no child is in it.

In some areas Certified Child Passenger Safety Technicians (CPSTs) are available to inspect and demonstrate how to correctly use and install child restraints. In the U.S., refer to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) website to locate the nearest child safety seat inspection station. For CPST availability in Canada, check with Transport Canada or the Provincial Ministry of Transportation office.

## Securing the Child Within the Child Restraint

<!-- image -->

## Warning

A child can be seriously injured or killed in a crash if the child is not properly secured in the child restraint. Secure the child properly following the instructions that came with that child restraint.

## Where to Put the Restraint

According to accident statistics, children and infants are safer when properly restrained in an appropriate child restraint secured in a rear seating position.

Whenever possible, children aged 12 and under should be secured in a rear seating position.

The vehicle is equipped with a front center airbag in the inboard side of the driver seat. Even with a front center airbag, a child restraint can be installed in any second row seating position.

Never put a rear-facing child restraint in the front. This is because the risk to the rear-facing child is so great if the airbag deploys.

<!-- image -->

## Warning

A child in a rear-facing child restraint can be seriously injured or killed if the front passenger airbag inflates. This is because the back of the rear-facing child restraint would be very close to the inflating airbag. A child in a forward-facing child restraint can be seriously injured or killed if the front passenger airbag inflates and the passenger seat is in a forward position.

Even if the passenger sensing system has

turned off the front passenger frontal airbag, no system is fail-safe. No one can guarantee that an airbag will not deploy under some unusual circumstance, even though it is turned off.

Secure rear-facing child restraints in a rear seat, even if the airbag is off. If you secure a forward-facing child restraint in the front seat, always move the front passenger seat as far back as it will go. It is better to secure the child restraint in a rear seat.

See Passenger Sensing System 3 69 for additional information.

(Continued)

## Warning (Continued)

If a child restraint is installed in a second row center seat, move the second row seat to the rearward position, whenever possible, to minimize contact with the front center airbag.

<!-- image -->

## Warning

A child in a child restraint in the center front seat can be badly injured or killed by the frontal airbags if they inflate. Never secure a child restraint in the center front seat. It is always better to secure a child restraint in a rear seat.

When securing a child restraint with the seat belts in a rear seat position, study the instructions that came with the child restraint to make sure it is compatible with this vehicle.

Child restraints and booster seats vary considerably in size, and some may fit in certain seating positions better than others. Do not install a child restraint in any rear seating position where it cannot be installed securely.

Depending on where you place the child restraint and the size of the child restraint, you may not be able to access adjacent seat belts or LATCH anchors for additional passengers or child restraints. Adjacent seating positions should not be used if the child restraint prevents access to or interferes with the routing of the seat belt.

Adjust the seat in front of a child restraint to ensure proper installation according to the child restraint manual. Move the front seat forward to avoid contact between the child restraint and the seat or any accessories mounted to the seat.

When installing a child restraint in an adjustable second row seating position, the seat should be adjusted fore or aft to ensure proper installation according to the child restraint manual. If the seat is able to recline, the seat back should be positioned to its full upright position before installing a child restraint.

Wherever a child restraint is installed, be sure to follow the instructions that came with the child restraint and secure the child restraint properly.

Keep in mind that an unsecured child restraint can move around in a collision or sudden stop and injure people in the vehicle. Be sure to properly secure any child restraint in the vehicle - even when no child is in it.

## Lower Anchors and Tethers for Children (LATCH System)

The LATCH system secures a child restraint during driving or in a crash. LATCH attachments on the child restraint are used to attach the child restraint to the anchors in the vehicle. This system is designed to make installation of a child restraint easier.

In order to use the LATCH system in your vehicle, you need a child restraint that has LATCH attachments. LATCH-compatible rear-

facing and forward-facing child seats can be properly installed using either the LATCH anchors or the vehicle's seat belts. Do not use both the seat belts and the LATCH anchorage system to secure a rear-facing or forwardfacing child restraint.

Booster seats use the vehicle's seat belts to secure the child and the booster seat. If the manufacturer recommends that the booster seat be secured with the LATCH system, this can be done as long as the booster seat can be positioned properly and there is no interference with the proper positioning of the lap-shoulder belt on the child.

Make sure to follow the instructions that came with the child restraint, and also the instructions in this manual.

When installing a child restraint with a top tether, you must also use either the lower anchors or the seat belts to properly secure the child restraint. A child restraint must never be attached using only the top tether.

For a forward-facing 5-pt harness child restraint where the combined weight of the child and restraint are up to 29.5 kg (65 lb), use either the lower LATCH anchorages with the top tether anchorage, or the seat belt with the top tether anchorage. Where the combined weight of the child and restraint are greater than 29.5 kg (65 lb), use the seat belt with the top tether anchorage only.

See Securing Child Restraints (With the Seat Belt in the Rear Seat) 3 88 Securing Child Restraints (With the Seat Belt in the Front Passenger Seat) 3 90 .

Child restraints built after March 2014 are labeled with the maximum child weight, with which the LATCH system can be used for installing the child restraint.

The following explains how to attach a child restraint with these attachments in the vehicle.

Not all vehicle seating positions have lower anchors. In this case, the seat belt must be used (with top tether where available) to secure the child restraint. See Securing Child Restraints (With the Seat Belt in the Rear Seat) 3 88 Securing Child Restraints (With the Seat Belt in the Front Passenger Seat) 3 90 .

## Lower Anchors

<!-- image -->

Lower anchors (1) are metal bars built into the vehicle. There are two lower anchors for each LATCH seating position that will accommodate a child restraint with lower attachments (2).

<!-- image -->

A top tether (3,4) is used to secure the top of the child restraint to the vehicle. A top tether anchor is built into the vehicle. The top tether attachment hook (2) on the child restraint connects to the top tether anchor in the vehicle in order to reduce the forward movement and rotation of the child restraint during driving or in the event of a crash.

The child restraint may have a single tether (3) or a dual tether (4). Either will have a single attachment hook (2) to secure the top tether to the anchor.

Some child restraints with a top tether are designed for use with or without the top tether being attached. Others require the top tether always to be attached. In Canada, the law requires that forward-facing child restraints have a top tether, and that the tether be attached. Be sure to read and follow the instructions for your child restraint.

For the third row seat, the top tether anchors are on the back of the seatback. Be sure to use an anchor located directly behind the seating position where the child restraint will be placed.

For models with a cargo cover, the top tether anchors are on the back of the rear seatbacks. Remove the cargo cover before installing the top tether. The cargo cover should remain off while the top tether is in use. Be sure to use an anchor directly behind the seating position where the child restraint will be placed.

Do not secure a child restraint in a position without a top tether anchor if a national or local law requires that the top tether be

attached, or if the instructions that come with the child restraint say that the top tether must be attached.

According to accident statistics, children and infants are safer when properly restrained in a child restraint system or infant restraint system secured in a rear seating position. See Where to Put the Restraint 3 79 for additional information.

## Securing a Child Restraint Designed for the LATCH System

<!-- image -->

## Warning

A child could be seriously injured or killed in a crash if the child restraint is not properly attached to the vehicle using either the LATCH anchors or the vehicle seat belt.  Follow the instructions that came with the child restraint and the instructions in this manual.

<!-- image -->

## Warning

To reduce the risk of serious or fatal injuries during a crash, do not attach more than one child restraint to a single anchor. Attaching more than one child restraint to a single anchor could cause the anchor or attachment to come loose or even break during a crash. A child or others could be injured.

<!-- image -->

## Warning

Children can be seriously injured or strangled if a shoulder belt is wrapped around their neck. The shoulder belt can tighten but cannot be loosened if it is locked. The shoulder belt locks when it is pulled all the way out of the retractor. It unlocks when the shoulder belt is allowed to go all the way back into the retractor, but it cannot do this if it is wrapped around a child's neck. If the shoulder belt is locked and tightened around a child's neck, the only way to loosen the belt is to cut it.

(Continued)

## Warning (Continued)

Buckle any unused seat belts behind the child restraint so children cannot reach them. Pull the shoulder belt all the way out of the retractor to set the lock, and tighten the belt behind the child restraint after the child restraint has been installed.

## Caution

Do not let the LATCH attachments rub against the vehicle's seat belts. This may damage these parts. If necessary, move buckled seat belts to avoid rubbing the LATCH attachments.

Do not fold the rear seatback when the seat is occupied. Do not fold the empty rear seat with a seat belt buckled. This could damage the seat belt or the seat. Unbuckle and return the seat belt to its stowed position, before folding the seat.

The vehicle is equipped with a front center airbag in the inboard side of the driver seat. Even with a front center airbag, a child restraint can be installed in any second row seating position.

If you need to secure more than one child restraint in the rear seat, see Where to Put the Restraint 3 79 .

- 1. Attach and tighten the lower attachments to the lower anchors. If the child restraint does not have lower attachments or the desired seating position does not have lower anchors, secure the child restraint with the seat belt and top tether when recommended by the child restraint manufacturer. Refer to your child restraint manufacturer instructions and the instructions in this manual.
- 1.1 Find the lower anchors for the desired seating position.
- 1.2 Put the child restraint on the seat.
- 1.3 Attach and tighten the lower attachments on the child restraint to the lower anchors.
- 2. If the child restraint manufacturer recommends that the top tether be attached, adjust the top tether to its full

length and attach it to the anchor. Refer to the child restraint instructions and the following steps:

- 2.1 Find the top tether anchor.
- 2.2 Route, attach, and tighten the top tether according to your child restraint instructions and the following instructions:

<!-- image -->

If the position you are using does not have a headrest or head restraint and you are using a single tether, route the tether over the seatback.

<!-- image -->

If the position you are using does not have a headrest or head restraint and you are using a dual tether, route the tether over the seatback.

<!-- image -->

If the position you are using has a fixed headrest or head restraint and you are using a single

tether, route the tether around the inboard side of the headrest or head restraint.

<!-- image -->

If the position you are using has a fixed or an adjustable head restraint and you are using a dual tether, route the tether around the head restraint.

If the child restraint is installed next to a center seat, make sure the top tether does not interfere with the center seating position shoulder belt/retractor. If it does, find another suitable seating position to install the child restraint.

- 3. Before placing a child in the child restraint, make sure it is securely held in place. To check, grasp the child restraint at the LATCH path and attempt to move it side to side

and back and forth. There should be no more than 2.5 cm (1 in) of movement, for proper installation.

## Replacing LATCH System Parts After a Crash

<!-- image -->

## Warning

A crash can damage the LATCH system in the vehicle. A damaged LATCH system may not properly secure the child restraint, resulting in serious injury or even death in a crash. To help make sure the LATCH system is working properly after a crash, see your dealer to have the system inspected and any necessary replacements made as soon as possible.

If the vehicle has the LATCH system and it was being used during a crash, new LATCH system parts may be needed.

New parts and repairs may be necessary even if the LATCH system was not being used at the time of the crash.

## Securing Child Restraints (With the Seat Belt in the Rear Seat)

The vehicle is equipped with a front center airbag in the inboard side of the driver seat. Even with a front center airbag, a child restraint can be installed in any second row seating position. If you install a child restraint in a second row center seat, move the second row seat to the rearward position, whenever possible, to minimize contact with the front center airbag.

When securing a child restraint with the seat belts in a rear seat position, study the instructions that came with the child restraint to make sure it is compatible with this vehicle.

If the child restraint has the LATCH system, see Lower Anchors and Tethers for Children (LATCH System) 3 81 for how and where to install the child restraint using LATCH. If a child restraint is secured in the vehicle using a seat belt and it uses a top tether, see Lower Anchors and Tethers for Children (LATCH System) 3 81 for top tether anchor locations.

Do not secure a child seat in a position without a top tether anchor if a national or local law requires that the top tether be anchored, or if the instructions that come with the child

restraint say that the top strap must be anchored. Refer to the instructions that came with the child restraint and see Lower Anchors and Tethers for Children (LATCH System) 3 81 .

In Canada, the law requires that forward-facing child restraints have a top tether, and that the tether be attached.

If the child restraint or vehicle seat position does not have the LATCH system, you will be using the seat belt to secure the child restraint. Be sure to follow the instructions that came with the child restraint.

If more than one child restraint needs to be installed in the rear seat, be sure to read Where to Put the Restraint 3 79 .

If the child restraint manufacturer recommends using a top tether, attach and tighten the top tether to the top tether anchor. Refer to the instructions that came with the child restraint and see Lower Anchors and Tethers for Children (LATCH System) 3 81 .

- 1. Put the child restraint on the seat.
- If the head restraint interferes with the proper installation of the child restraint, the head restraint may be removed. See "Head
- Restraint Removal and Reinstallation" under Lower Anchors and Tethers for Children (LATCH System) 3 81 .
- 2. Pick up the latch plate and run the lap and shoulder portions of the vehicle seat belt through or around the child restraint. Ensure the seat belt webbing is routed as directly as possible and is not caught on seat handles or plastic trim. The child restraint instructions will show you how.

<!-- image -->

- 3. Push the latch plate into the buckle until it clicks.
- Position the release pushbutton on the buckle, away from the child restraint, so that the seat belt could be quickly unbuckled if necessary.

There must not be direct contact of the child restraint to the release pushbutton.

<!-- image -->

- 4. Pull the shoulder belt all the way out of the retractor to set the lock. When the retractor lock is set, the belt can be tightened but not pulled out of the retractor.

<!-- image -->

- 5. To tighten the belt, push down on the child restraint, pull the shoulder portion of the belt to tighten the lap portion of the belt, and feed the shoulder belt back into the retractor. When installing a forward-facing child restraint, it may be helpful to use your knee to push down on the child restraint as you tighten the belt.
- Try to pull the belt out of the retractor to make sure the retractor is locked. If the retractor is not locked, repeat Steps 4 and 5.
- 6. For forward-facing child restraints, attach and tighten the top tether to the top tether anchor (loop). Refer to the child restraint instructions, the vehicle LATCH anchor

weight limits, and instructions listed in Lower Anchors and Tethers for Children (LATCH System) 3 81 .

- 7. Before placing a child in the child restraint, make sure it is securely held in place. To check, grasp the child restraint at the seat belt path and attempt to move it side to side and back and forth. When the child restraint is properly installed, there should be no more than 2.5 cm (1 in) of movement.

To remove the child restraint, unbuckle the vehicle seat belt and let it return to the stowed position. If the top tether is attached to a top tether anchor, disconnect it.

If the head restraint was removed, reinstall it before the seating position is used. See "Head Restraint Removal and Reinstallation" under Lower Anchors and Tethers for Children (LATCH System) 3 81 for additional information on installing the head restraint properly.

## Securing Child Restraints (With the Seat Belt in the Front Passenger Seat)

This vehicle has airbags. A rear seat is a safer place to secure a forward-facing child restraint. See Where to Put the Restraint 3 79 .

In addition, the vehicle has a passenger sensing system which is designed to turn off the front outboard passenger frontal airbag under certain conditions. See Passenger Sensing System 3 69 and Passenger Airbag Status Indicator 3 115 for more information, including important safety information.

Never put a rear-facing child restraint in the front. This is because the risk to the rear-facing child is so great, if the airbag deploys.

<!-- image -->

## Warning

A child in a rear-facing child restraint can be seriously injured or killed if the front outboard passenger frontal airbag inflates. This is because the back of the rear-facing child restraint would be very close to the

(Continued)

## Warning (Continued)

inflating airbag. A child in a forward-facing child restraint can be seriously injured or killed if the front outboard passenger frontal airbag inflates and the passenger seat is in a forward position.

Even if the passenger sensing system has turned off the front outboard passenger frontal airbag, no system is fail-safe. No one can guarantee that an airbag will not deploy under some unusual circumstance, even though it is turned off.

Secure rear-facing child restraints in a rear seat, even if the airbag is off. If you secure a forward-facing child restraint in the front outboard passenger seat, always move the seat as far back as it will go. It is better to secure the child restraint in a rear seat.

See Passenger Sensing System 3 69 for additional information.

If the child restraint uses a top tether, see Lower Anchors and Tethers for Children (LATCH System) 3 81 for top tether anchor locations.

Do not secure a child seat in a position without a top tether anchor if a national or local law requires that the top tether be anchored, or if the instructions that come with the child restraint say that the top tether must be anchored.

In Canada, the law requires that forward-facing child restraints have a top tether, and that the tether be attached.

When using the lap-shoulder belt to secure the child restraint in this position, follow the instructions that came with the child restraint and the following instructions:

- 1. Move the seat as far back as it will go before securing the forward-facing child restraint. Move the seat upward or the seatback to an upright position, if needed, to get a tight installation of the child restraint. There must be finger clearance between the release pushbutton and the child restraint.

When the passenger sensing system has turned off the front outboard passenger frontal airbag, the OFF indicator on the passenger airbag status indicator should light and stay lit when you start the vehicle. See Passenger Airbag Status Indicator 3 115 .

- 2. Put the child restraint on the seat.
- 3. Pick up the latch plate and run the lap and shoulder portions of the vehicle seat belt through or around the restraint. Ensure the seat belt webbing is routed as direct as possible and is not caught on seat handles or plastic trim. The child restraint instructions will show you how.

<!-- image -->

- 4. Push the latch plate into the buckle until it clicks.
- Position the release pushbutton on the buckle, away from the child restraint, so that the seat belt could be quickly unbuckled if necessary.

<!-- image -->

- 5. Pull the shoulder belt all the way out of the retractor to set the lock. When the retractor lock is set, the belt can be tightened but not pulled out of the retractor.

<!-- image -->

- 6. To tighten the belt, push down on the child restraint, pull the shoulder portion of the belt to tighten the lap portion of the belt, and feed the shoulder belt back into the retractor.

There must be finger clearance between the release pushbutton and the child restraint. If there is not clearance between the buckle release pushbutton and the child restraint, move the seat upward and repeat prior installation steps. Otherwise secure the child restraint in a rear seat.

When installing a forward-facing child restraint, it may be helpful to use your knee to push down on the child restraint as you tighten the belt.

Try to pull the belt out of the retractor to make sure the retractor is locked. If the retractor is not locked, repeat Steps 5 and 6.

- 7. Before placing a child in the child restraint, make sure it is securely held in place. To check, grasp the child restraint at the seat belt path and attempt to move it side to side and back and forth. When the child restraint is properly installed, there should be no more than 2.5 cm (1 in) of movement.

If the airbag is off, the OFF indicator in the passenger airbag status indicator will come on and stay on when the vehicle is started.

If a child restraint has been installed and the ON indicator is lit, see 'If the On Indicator Is Lit for a Child Restraint' under Passenger Sensing System 3 69 .

To remove the child restraint, unbuckle the vehicle seat belt and let it return to the stowed position.

## Roof Rack System

The vehicle may be equipped with side-rails for a roof rack system. Cargo must be secured with properly installed cross rails and other accessories designed to carry cargo. These can be purchased from your dealer.

<!-- image -->

## Warning

Before driving and occasionally during a trip, check that cargo is securely fastened, rests evenly between the cross rails and does not block the vehicle's lamps or windows. Never load cargo directly on the roof of the vehicle or allow cargo to hang over the rear or sides of the vehicle. Never load cargo without first properly installing cross rails and other accessories designed to carry cargo. Personal injury, death or damage to the vehicle or other property may occur.

If driving for a long distance, on rough roads, or at high speeds, occasionally stop the vehicle to make sure the cargo remains in its place.

## Cargo Weight Limits

Do not exceed the maximum cargo weight for the roof rack system, including the weight of the cross rails and any other accessories used to carry the cargo such as bike racks or roof boxes. The maximum cargo weight that can be loaded onto the roof rack system is 100 kg (220

lb) or the weight designated in the instructions that came with the cross rails or other roof rack accessories, whichever is less.

<!-- image -->

## Warning

Never load the roof rack with more weight than specified in this section. Loading cargo on the roof rack will make the vehicle's center of gravity higher. To avoid losing control of the vehicle, avoid overloading, high speeds, sudden starts, sharp turns, sudden braking, or abrupt maneuvers when carrying cargo on the roof rack.

The weight of any cargo carried on the roof rack system must be included in calculating the loaded weight of the vehicle. Do not exceed the maximum vehicle capacity when loading the vehicle, including cargo carried on the roof rack system and passengers and cargo carried in the vehicle. For more information on vehicle capacity and loading, see Vehicle Load Limits 3 218 .

When the indicator nears empty, the low fuel light comes on. There still is a little fuel left, but the vehicle should be refueled soon.

The fuel gauge may:

- · Moves a little while turning a corner, speeding up, or braking.
- · Take a little more, or less fuel to fill up than it indicates. For example, the gauge may have indicated the tank is half full, but it actually will take a little more, or less than half the tank's capacity to fill the tank.
- · Take a few seconds to stabilize after the ignition is turned on and goes back to empty when the ignition is turned off.

These are normal conditions, none of which indicate a problem with the fuel gauge.

English

<!-- image -->

## Caution

Lack of proper engine oil maintenance can damage the engine. Driving with the engine oil  low can also damage the engine. The repairs would not be covered by the vehicle warranty. Check the oil level as soon as possible. Add oil if required, but if the oil level is within the operating range and the oil pressure is still low, have the vehicle serviced. Always follow the maintenance schedule for changing engine oil.

The engine oil pressure gauge shows the engine oil pressure in kPa (kilopascals) or psi (pounds per square inch) when the engine is running.

This gauge displays on the infotainment display. If Show in Cluster is selected a digital value is shown on the instrument cluster in the left zone.

Oil pressure can vary with engine speed, outside temperature, coolant temperature, and oil viscosity.

On some models, the oil pump will vary engine oil pressure according to engine needs. Oil pressure may change quickly as the engine speed or load varies. This is normal. If the oil pressure warning light or Driver Information Center (DIC) message indicates oil pressure outside the normal operating range, check the vehicle's oil as soon as possible.

See Engine Oil 3 349 .

## Engine Coolant Temperature Gauge

Metric

If the vehicle is operating outside the normal operating range, the charging system light comes on. See Charging System Light 3 115 . The voltmeter gauge may also read lower when in fuel economy mode. This is normal.

Readings outside the normal operating range can also occur when a large number of electrical accessories are operating in the vehicle and the engine is left idling for an extended period. This condition is normal since the charging system is not able to provide full power at engine idle. As engine speeds are increased, this condition should correct itself as higher engine speeds allow the charging system to create maximum power.

The vehicle can only be driven for a short time with the readings outside the normal operating range. If the vehicle must be driven, turn off all accessories, such as the radio and air conditioner.

Readings outside the normal operating range indicate a possible problem in the electrical system. Have the vehicle serviced as soon as possible.

## Universal Remote System

See Radio Frequency Statement 3 448 .

## Universal Remote System Programming

<!-- image -->

If equipped, these buttons are in the overhead console.

This system can replace up to three remote control transmitters used to activate devices such as garage door openers, security systems, and home automation devices. These instructions refer to a garage door opener, but can be used for other devices.

Do not use the Universal Remote system with any garage door opener that does not have the stop and reverse feature. This includes any garage door opener model manufactured before April 1, 1982.

Keep the original hand-held transmitter for use in other vehicles as well as for future programming. Erase the programming when vehicle ownership is terminated. See 'Erasing Universal Remote System Buttons' later in this section.

To program a garage door opener, park outside directly in line with and facing the garage door opener receiver. Clear all people and objects near the garage door.

Make sure the hand-held transmitter has a new battery for quick and accurate transmission of the radio-frequency signal.

## Programming the Universal Remote System

Programming involves time-sensitive actions and may time out, requiring the procedure to be repeated. Read these instructions completely before programming the Universal Remote system. It may help to have another person assist with the programming process.

- 1. Hold the end of the hand-held transmitter about 3 to 8 cm (1 to 3 in) away from the Universal Remote system buttons with the indicator light in view. The hand-held transmitter was supplied by the manufacturer of the garage door opener receiver.
- 2. Press and release one of the three Universal Remote system buttons to be programmed. Press and hold the hand-held transmitter button. Do not release the hand-held transmitter button until the indicator light changes from a slow to a rapid flash or continuous light. Then release the handheld transmitter button.

Some garage door openers may require substitution of Step 2 with the procedure under 'Radio Signals for Some Gate Operators' later in this section.

- 3. Press and hold the newly programmed Universal Remote system button for five seconds while watching the indicator light and garage door activation.

- · If the indicator light stays on continuously or the garage door moves when the button is pressed, then programming is complete. There is no need to complete Steps 4-6.
- · If the garage door does not move, continue with programming Steps 4-6.
- · If the indicator light does not come on or the garage door does not move, a second button press may be required. For a second time, press and hold the newly programmed button for five seconds. If the indicator light stays on continuously or the garage door moves when the button is pressed, then programming is complete. There is no need to complete Steps 4-6.

<!-- image -->

## Learn or Smart Button

- 4. After completing Steps 1-3, locate the Learn or Smart button inside garage on the garage door opener receiver. The name and color of the button may vary by manufacturer.
- 5. Press and release the Learn or Smart button. Step 6 must be completed within 30 seconds of pressing this button.
- 6. Return to the vehicle and firmly press and hold the trained Universal Remote system button for two seconds and release. Repeat the 'press/hold/release' sequence up to three times to complete the training process.

The Universal Remote system should now activate the garage door. Repeat the process for programming the remaining two buttons.

For questions or programming help, visit www.homelink.com/gm for self-help videos, or call 1-800-355-3515. For calls placed outside the U.S., Canada, or Puerto Rico, international rates will apply and may differ based on landline or mobile phone.

## Radio Signals for Some Gate Operators

Some gate operators and radio-frequency laws require transmitter signals to time out or quit after several seconds of transmission. This may not be long enough for the Universal Remote system to pick up the signal during programming.

If the programming did not work, replace Step 2 under 'Programming the Universal Remote System' with the following:

Press and hold the Universal Remote system button while pressing and releasing the handheld transmitter button every two seconds until the signal has been successfully accepted by the Universal Remote system. The Universal Remote system indicator light will flash slowly at first and then change to a rapid flash or continuous solid-light. Proceed with Step 3 under 'Programming the Universal Remote System' to complete.

## Universal Remote System

## Operation

AUTO: Automatically turns the exterior lamps on and off, depending on outside lighting. ; : Turns on all lamps, except the headlamps. 2

: Turns on the headlamps together with the parking lamps and instrument panel lights.

## IntelliBeam System

If equipped, this system turns the vehicle's high-beam headlamps on and off according to surrounding traffic conditions.

The system turns the high-beam headlamps on when it is dark enough and there is no other traffic present.

This light b comes on in the instrument cluster when the IntelliBeam system is enabled.

## Turning On and Enabling IntelliBeam

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

To enable the IntelliBeam system, press b on the turn signal lever when it is dark outside and the exterior lamp control is in AUTO or 2 .

## Driving with IntelliBeam

The system only activates the high beams when driving over 40 km/h (25 mph).

The blue high-beam on light appears on the instrument cluster when the high beams are on.

There is a sensor near the top center of the windshield that automatically controls the system. Keep this area of the windshield clear of debris to allow for best system performance.

The high-beam headlamps remain on, under the automatic control, until one of the following situations occurs:

- · The system detects a preceding vehicle's taillamps.
- · The system detects an approaching vehicle's headlamps.
- · The outside light is bright enough that high-beam headlamps are not required.
- · The vehicle's speed drops below 20 km/h (12 mph).
- · The IntelliBeam system is disabled by the button on the turn signal lever. If this happens, press b on the turn signal lever when the exterior lamp control is in the AUTO or 2 position to reactivate the

IntelliBeam system. The instrument cluster light will come on to indicate the IntelliBeam system is reactivated.

The high beams may not turn off automatically if the system cannot detect another vehicle's lamps because of any of the following:

- · The other vehicle's lamps are covered with dirt, snow, and/or road spray.
- · The other vehicle's lamps are missing, damaged, obstructed from view, or otherwise undetected.
- · The other vehicle's lamps cannot be detected due to dense exhaust, smoke, fog, snow, road spray, mist, or other airborne obstructions.
- · The vehicle is loaded such that the front end points upward, causing the light sensor to aim high and not detect headlamps and taillamps.
- · The vehicle's windshield is dirty, cracked, or obstructed by something that blocks the view of the light sensor.
- · The vehicle is being driven on winding or hilly roads.

The automatic high-beam headlamps may need to be disabled if any of the above conditions exist.

## Adaptive Headlight System

If equipped, the Adaptive Headlight system allows the high beam to function as the main driving light at night. There is a sensor near the top center of the windshield that automatically detects the lights of oncoming and preceding vehicles. Keep this area of the windshield clear of debris to allow for best system performance.

The system turns on all the high-beam headlamp LED segments when it is dark enough and there is no other traffic present.

## Turning On and Enabling Adaptive Headlight System

<!-- image -->

To enable the Adaptive Headlight system, press b on the turn signal lever when it is dark outside and the exterior lamp control is in AUTO or 2 .

## Driving with Adaptive Headlight System

The system only activates the high beams when driving over 40 km/h (25  mph).

Individual segments of the headlamp high beam are faded out according to the traffic situation, preventing high beam light from glaring oncoming or preceding traffic. This gives the best light distribution without glaring other road users.

The Adaptive Headlight System remains on until one of the following situations occurs:

- · The outside light is bright enough that high-beam headlamps are not required.
- · The fog lamps are turned on.
- · The vehicle speed drops below approximately 20 km/h (12 mph).
- · The Adaptive Headlight system is disabled by the button on the turn signal lever. To reactivate the system, press b on the turn signal lever when the exterior lamp control is in the AUTO or 2 position. The instrument cluster light will appear to indicate the Adaptive Headlight system is reactivated.

The high beams may not turn off automatically if the system cannot detect another vehicle lamps because of any of the following:

- · The other vehicle lamps are covered with dirt, snow, and/or road spray.
- · The other vehicle lamps are missing, damaged, obstructed from view, or otherwise undetected.
- · The other vehicle lamps cannot be detected due to dense exhaust, smoke, fog, snow, road spray, mist, or other airborne obstructions.
- · The vehicle is loaded in a way that the front end points upward, causing the light sensor to aim high and not detect headlamps and taillamps.
- · The vehicle windshield is dirty, cracked, or obstructed by something that blocks the view of the light sensor.
- · The vehicle is being driven on winding or hilly roads.

The Adaptive Headlight system may need to be disabled if any of the above conditions exist.

## Headlamp High/Low-Beam Changer

Push the turn signal lever away from you and release to turn the high beams on.

To return to low beams, push the lever again or pull it toward you and release.

<!-- image -->

When the high-beam headlamps are on, this indicator light on the instrument cluster will also be on.

## Flash-to-Pass

This feature lets you use the high-beam headlamps to signal a driver in front of you that you want to pass. It works even if the headlamps are in the automatic position.

To use it, pull the turn signal lever toward you, then release it.

The high beam headlamps will stay on as long as you hold the lever toward you. The high-beam indicator on the instrument cluster will come on. Release the lever to return to normal operation.

## Daytime Running Lamps (DRL)

DRL can make it easier for others to see the front of the vehicle during the day. Fully functional DRL are required on all vehicles first sold in Canada.

The DRL system comes on when the following conditions are met:

- · The exterior lamp control is in AUTO.
- · The ignition is on.
- · The light sensor determines it is daytime.

When the DRL system is on, only the DRL are on. The taillamps, sidemarker lamps, instrument panel lights, and other lamps will not be on.

When it begins to get dark, the automatic

headlamp system switches from DRL to the headlamps.

To turn off the DRL, turn the exterior lamp control to O and then release. For vehicles first sold in Canada, off will only work when the vehicle is parked.

## Automatic Headlamp System

When it is dark enough outside, the automatic headlamp system turns on the headlamps at the normal brightness, along with the

taillamps, sidemarker, parking lamps, and the instrument panel lights. The radio lights will also be dim.

To turn off the automatic headlamp system, turn the exterior lamp control to P and then release it.

<!-- image -->

The vehicle has a light sensor on the top of the instrument panel that controls the automatic headlamp system. Do not cover the sensor, otherwise the headlamps may come on when they are not needed.

The system may also turn on the headlamps when driving through a parking garage, heavy overcast weather, or a tunnel. This is normal.

There is a delay in the transition between the daytime and nighttime operation of the automatic headlamp system so that driving under bridges or bright overhead street lights does not affect the system. The automatic headlamp system is only affected when the light sensor detects a change in lighting lasting longer than the delay.

If the vehicle is started in a dark garage, the automatic headlamp system will come on immediately. Once the vehicle leaves the garage, there is a slight delay for the automatic headlamp system to change if it is bright enough outside. During that delay, the instrument cluster may not be as bright as usual. Make sure the instrument panel brightness control is in the full bright position. See Instrument Panel Illumination Control 3 142 .

To idle the vehicle with the automatic headlamp system off, turn the control to the off position.

The headlamps will also stay on after you exit the vehicle.

The regular headlamp system can be turned on when needed.

## Lights On with Wipers

If the windshield wipers are activated in daylight with the engine on, and the exterior lamp control is in AUTO, the headlamps, parking lamps, and other exterior lamps come on. The transition time for the lamps coming on varies based on wiper speed. When the wipers are not operating, these lamps turn off. Move the exterior lamp control to P or ; to disable this feature.

## Adaptive Forward Lighting (AFL)

If equipped with the AFL system, the high-beam headlamps move horizontally while turning the steering wheel to provide greater road illumination around curves.

<!-- image -->

To activate AFL, set the exterior lamp control to the Auto or 2 position, and Adaptive Headlight system is active. See Exterior Lamp Controls 3 136 .

To adjust the AFL setting, go to the infotainment home screen and select Settings > Vehicle > Lighting.

Moving the exterior lamp controls out of the Auto or 2 position will deactivate the system. The high-beam headlamps can move horizontally when the vehicle speed is greater than 3 km/h (2 mph). Headlamps will not move horizontally when the transmission is in R (Reverse).

If equipped, the AFL system automatically modifies the low-beam lighting patterns to the situation to enable optimal light performance for the driver. Light distribution and intensity of low-beam light are controlled based on exterior lighting conditions, vehicle location, and driving situations.

## Town Light

If equipped, the town light activates automatically at a speed of 30 km/h (18 mph) up to 55 km/h (34 mph).

<!-- image -->

The light is wide and symmetrical. The special beam pattern is designed to prevent glare for other road users.

## Country Light

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

If equipped, the country light activates automatically at a speed above 55 km/h (34 mph).

The illumination of the current lane and the side of the road is improved, reducing glare to oncoming and preceding vehicles.

## Freeway/Motorway Light

<!-- image -->

If equipped, the adverse weather light activates automatically when driving in adverse weather conditions (heavy rain, snow, sleet, freezing rain, etc.).

The illumination is shifted more to the side of the road to highlight road signs, and reduces glare caused by reflecting of wet roads.

## Maneuvering Light

<!-- image -->

If equipped, when driving faster than 90 km/h (55 mph) on freeways, the low-beam illumination is smaller and extended.

## Adverse Weather Light

If equipped, the maneuvering light activates automatically at speeds less than 7 km/h (4 mph) when the vehicle is in R (Reverse). The maneuvering light illumination improves parking and maneuvering situations.

## Headlamp Leveling Control

An arrow on the instrument cluster flashes in the direction of the turn or lane change.

Move the turn signal lever all the way up or down to signal a turn.

Raise or lower the lever for less than one second until the arrow starts to flash to signal a lane change. This causes the turn signals to automatically flash three times. It will flash six times if Tow/Haul Mode is active. Holding the

turn signal lever for more than one second will cause the turn signals to flash until the lever is released.

The lever returns to its starting position whenever it is released.

If after signaling a turn or a lane change the arrows flash rapidly or do not come on, a signal bulb could be burned out.

Replace any burned out bulbs. If a bulb is not burned out, check the fuse. See Fuses and Circuit Breakers 3 368 .

## Turn Signal On Chime

If the turn signal is left on for more than 1.2 km (0.75 mi), a chime sounds at each flash of the turn signal. The message TURN SIGNAL ON will also appear in the Driver Information Center (DIC). To turn the chime and message off, move the turn signal lever to the off position.

Entry lighting can be disabled manually by closing all doors, pressing Q on the remote key, or starting the vehicle.

This feature can be changed. On the infotainment home screen, select Settings > Vehicle > Lighting.

## Approach Detection

If equipped, the entry lighting feature will automatically turn on when the remote key is detected within approximately 2 m (6 ft) of the vehicle.

If the vehicle has remained parked for an extended period of time with no remote key use or keyless access operation, approach detection will be disabled. To reactivate, press any button on the remote key or open and close all vehicle doors to re-enable the entry lighting feature on approach.

## Exit Lighting

Some exterior lamps and interior lamps turn on when the driver door is opened after the vehicle is turned off.

The exterior and interior lamps remain on for a set amount of time, then automatically turn off.

The interior lights turn on when the vehicle is turned off.

The exterior lamps turn off immediately by turning the exterior lamp control off.

This feature can be changed. On the infotainment home screen, select Settings > Vehicle > Lighting.

## Battery Load Management

The vehicle has Electric Power Management (EPM), which estimates the battery's temperature and state of charge. It then adjusts the voltage for best performance and extended life of the battery.

When the battery's state of charge is low, the voltage is raised slightly to quickly bring the charge back up. When the state of charge is high, the voltage is lowered slightly to prevent overcharging. The voltmeter gauge or the voltage display on the Driver Information Center (DIC), if equipped, may show the voltage moving up or down. This is normal. If there is a problem, an alert will be displayed.

The battery can be discharged at idle if the electrical loads are very high. This is true for all vehicles. This is because the generator (alternator) may not be spinning fast enough at idle to produce all the power that is needed for very high electrical loads.

A high electrical load occurs when several of the following are on, such as: headlamps, high beams, fog lamps, rear window defogger, climate control fan at high speed, heated seats, engine cooling fans, trailer loads, and loads plugged into accessory power outlets. EPM works to prevent excessive discharge of

the battery. It does this by balancing the generator's output and the vehicle's electrical needs. It can increase engine idle speed to generate more power, whenever needed. It can temporarily reduce the power demands of some accessories.

Normally, these actions occur in steps or levels, without being noticeable. In rare cases at the highest levels of corrective action, this action may be noticeable to the driver. If so, a DIC message might be displayed and it is recommended that the driver reduce the electrical loads as much as possible.

## Battery Power Protection

This feature helps prevent the battery from being drained, if the interior courtesy lamps or reading lamps are accidentally left on. If any of these lamps are left on, they automatically turn

off after 10 minutes, if the ignition is off. The lamps will not come back on again until one of the following occurs:

- · The doors are closed and then re-opened.
- · The ignition is turned on.

## Exterior Lighting Battery Saver

The exterior lamps turn off about 10 minutes after the vehicle is turned off, if the parking lamps or headlamps have been manually left on. This protects against draining the battery. To restart the 10-minute timer, turn the exterior lamp control to the O position and then back to the ; or 2 position.

## Radio Reception

Unplug any electronic devices from the accessory power outlets if there is static interference.

## FM

FM signals only reach about 16 to 65 km (10 to 40 mi). Although the radio has a built-in electronic circuit that automatically works to reduce interference, some static can occur, especially around tall buildings or hills, causing the sound to fade in and out.

## AM

The range for most AM stations is greater than FM, especially at night. The longer range may also cause station frequencies to interfere with each other. Storms and power lines may also interfere with radio reception. Try reducing the treble on the radio if static interference occurs.

## SiriusXM Satellite Radio Service

If equipped, SiriusXM Satellite Radio Service provides digital radio reception. Tall buildings or hills can interfere with satellite radio signals, causing the sound to fade in and out. In addition, traveling or parking under heavy foliage, bridges, garages, or tunnels may cause loss of the SiriusXM signal for a period of time. Some cellular services may interfere with SXM reception causing signal loss.

## Mobile Devices

Making or receiving calls, charging, or just having a mobile device on may cause static interference. Unplug or turn off any mobile devices if this happens.

## Multi-Band Antenna

The roof antenna may be used for radio, navigation, and OnStar, depending on the equipped options. Keep clear of obstructions for clear reception. If the vehicle has a sunroof, and it is open, reception can also be affected.

## Audio Players

## Avoiding Untrusted Media Devices

When using media devices such as USB and mobile devices, consider the source. Untrusted media devices could contain files that affect system operation or performance and should be avoided.

## USB Port

Audio stored on a USB device may be listened to.

The vehicle may be equipped with two USB ports in the center console under the armrest and another two on the center stack. These ports are for data and charging. There may also be two USB ports at the rear of the center console and a USB port on each side of the third row seats for charging only.

## Caution

To avoid vehicle damage, unplug all accessories and disconnect all accessory cables from the vehicle when not in use. Accessory cables left plugged into the vehicle, unconnected to a device, could be damaged or cause an electrical short if the unconnected end comes in contact with liquids or another power source such as the accessory power outlet.

The GPS shows the current position of the vehicle using signals sent by GPS satellites. When the vehicle is not receiving signals from the satellites, a symbol appears in the status bar.

This system might not be available or interference can occur if any of the following are true:

- · Satellites are being repaired or improved.
- · Signals are obstructed by tall buildings, trees, large trucks, or a tunnel.

For more information if the GPS is not functioning properly, see Problems with Route Guidance 3 174 and If the System Needs Service 3 175 .

## Vehicle Positioning

At times, the position of the vehicle on the map could be inaccurate due to one or more of the following reasons:

- · The vehicle is driving on slippery road surfaces such as sand, gravel, or snow.
- · The road system has changed.
- · The vehicle is traveling on winding roads or long, straight roads.
- · The surface streets run parallel to a freeway.
- · The vehicle is approaching a tall building or a large vehicle.
- · The vehicle has been transferred by a vehicle carrier or a ferry.
- · The vehicle is traveling at high speed.
- · The current position calibration is set incorrectly.
- · The vehicle changes directions more than once, or the vehicle is turning on a turn table in a parking lot.
- · The GPS signal is not received.
- · The vehicle is entering and/or exiting a parking lot, garage, or a lot with a roof.
- · A roof carrier is installed on the vehicle.
- · The tires are replaced or worn.
- · Tire chains are installed on the vehicle.
- · The tire pressure for the tires is incorrect.
- · The 12-volt battery has been disconnected for several days.
- · This is the first navigation use after the map data is updated.
- · The vehicle is driving in heavy traffic where driving is at low speeds, and the vehicle is stopped and started repeatedly.

## Problems with Route Guidance

Inappropriate route guidance can occur under one or more of the following conditions:

- · Route guidance might not be available when using automatic rerouting for the next right or left turn.
- · The turn was not made on the road indicated.
- · The route might not be changed when using automatic rerouting.
- · There is no route guidance when turning at an intersection.
- · Plural names of places might be announced occasionally.
- · Automatic rerouting might display a route returning to the set waypoint if heading for a destination without passing through a set waypoint.
- · It could take a long time to operate automatic rerouting during highspeed driving.
- · The route prohibits the entry of a vehicle due to a regulation by time or season or any other regulation which may be given.
- · The route to the destination might not be shown if there are new roads, if roads have recently changed, or if certain roads are not listed in the map data. See Maps 3 168 .
- · Some routes might not be searched.

To recalibrate the vehicle's position on the map, park with the vehicle running for two to five minutes, until the vehicle position updates. Make sure the vehicle is parked in a location that is safe and has a clear view of the sky and away from large obstructions.

## If the System Needs Service

If the navigation system needs service, see your dealer.

## Map Data Updates

The map data in the vehicle is the most up-todate information available when the vehicle was produced.

See www.gmnavdisc.com for details on ordering, purchasing, and installing a new or replacement SD card. Features are subject to change. For more information on this feature, see my.cadillac.com/learn.

## Database Coverage Explanations

Coverage areas vary with respect to the level of map detail available for any given area. Some areas feature greater levels of detail than others. If this happens, it does not mean there is a problem with the system. As the map data is updated, more detail can become available for areas that previously had limited detail. See Map Data Updates 3 175 .

## Voice Recognition

If equipped, voice recognition allows for handsfree operation within the navigation, audio, and phone. This feature can be started by pressing g on the steering wheel.

However, not all features within these areas are supported by voice commands. Generally, only complex tasks that require multiple manual interactions to complete are supported by voice commands.

For example, tasks that take more than one or two touches, such as a song or artist to play from a media device, would be supported by voice commands. Other tasks, like adjusting the volume or seeking up or down, are audio features that are easily performed by touching one or two options, and are not supported by voice commands.

In general there are flexible ways to speak commands for completing the tasks.

If your language supports it, try stating a oneshot command, such as 'Directions to address <number, street, city, state/province>.' Do not include the ZIP code while stating the address during the command. Another example of a one-shot Destination Entry command is, 'Directions to Place of Interest at <hotel>.' If

these commands do not work, try saying, 'Take me to Place of Interest' or 'Find address' and the system will walk you through by asking additional questions.

## Hybrid Speech Recognition

If equipped, this feature helps distinguish words by using Internet-based information along with the system's voice recognition database. This allows you to speak more naturally when using voice recognition.

## Using Voice Recognition

Voice recognition becomes available once the system has been initialized. This begins when the ignition is turned on. Initialization may take a few moments.

- 1. Press g on the steering wheel controls to activate voice recognition.
- 2. The audio system mutes and the system plays a prompt.
- 3. Clearly speak one of the commands described in this section.
- A voice recognition system prompt can be interrupted while it is playing by pressing g again.

Once voice recognition is started, both the infotainment display and instrument cluster show the selections and visual dialog content. These displays can be turned on or off in the Tutorial Mode under Settings 3 186 .

There are three voice prompt modes supported:

- · Short prompts: This type of prompt will provide simple instructions about what can be stated.
- · Informative verbal prompts: This type of prompt will provide more information regarding the supported actions.
- · Auto informative prompts: This type of prompt plays during the first few speech sessions, then automatically switches to the short prompt after some experience has been gained through using the system.

If a command is not spoken, the voice recognition system says a help prompt.

## Prompts and Infotainment Displays

While a voice recognition session is active, there may be corresponding options showing on the displays. A selection can be made by manually touching the option, or by speaking the number for the option to select.

Manual interaction in the voice recognition session is permitted. Interaction during a voice session may be completed entirely using voice commands while some manual commands may expedite a task. If a selection is made using a manual control, the voice recognition dialog will progress in the same way as if the selection were made using a voice command. Once the system completes the task, or the session is terminated, the voice recognition dialog stops.

An example of this type of manual intervention is touching an entry of a displayed number list instead of speaking the number associated with the entry desired.

## Canceling Voice Recognition

- · Touch or say 'Cancel' or 'Exit' to terminate the voice recognition session and show the display where voice recognition was initiated.
- · Press any MFC button or press g , C , B ,
- e , 6 , 0 , or the thumbwheel on the steering wheel controls to terminate the voice recognition session and show the display where voice recognition was initiated.

## Natural Language Commands

Most languages do not support natural language commands in sentence form. For those languages, use direct commands like the examples shown on the display.

## Helpful Hints for Speaking Commands

Voice recognition can understand commands that are naturally stated in sentence form or direct commands that state the application and the task.

## For best results:

- · Speak the command naturally, not too fast, not too slow.
- · Listen for the prompt before saying a command or reply.
- · Use direct commands without a lot of extra words. For example, 'Call <name> at work,' 'Play' followed by the artist or song name, or 'Tune' followed by the radio station number.
- · Navigation destinations can be made in a single command using keywords. A few examples are: 'I want directions to an address,' 'I need to find a place of interest or (POI),' or 'Find contact.'

The system responds by requesting more details. For other POIs, say the name of a category like 'Restaurants,' 'Shopping Malls,' or 'Hospitals.'

- · Navigating to a destination outside of the current country takes more than one command. The first command is to tell the system where the navigation will take place, such as an Address, Intersection, POI, or Contact. If Address or Intersection is selected, the second command is to say, 'Change Country.' Once the system responds, say the country before saying the rest of the address and/or intersection.
- If POI is asked for, say 'Change Location,' then 'Change Country.'

Direct commands might be more clearly understood by the system. An example of a direct command would be 'Call <number>.' Examples of these direct commands are displayed on most of the screens while a voice session is active. If 'Phone' or 'Phone Commands,' is spoken, the system understands that a phone call is requested and will respond with questions until enough details are gathered to make a call.

If a cell phone number has been saved with a name and a place, the direct command should include both, for example 'Call <name> at work.'

## Using Voice Recognition for List Options

When a list is displayed, a voice prompt will ask to confirm or select an option from that list.

When a display contains a list, there may be options that are available but not displayed. The list on a voice recognition screen functions the same as a list on other displays. Scrolling or flinging can be used to help display other entries from the list.

Manually scrolling or paging the list on a display during a voice recognition session suspends the current voice recognition event and plays the prompt 'Please select manually or touch the Back icon on the infotainment display to try again.'

If manual selection takes more than 15 seconds, the session terminates and prompts that it has timed out. The display returns to the display where voice recognition was initiated.

## The Back Command

Say 'Back' or touch the Back icon on the infotainment display to go to the previous menu.

If in voice recognition, and 'Back' is spoken all the way back to the starting display, and then 'Back' is spoken one more time, the voice recognition session will cancel.

## Help

Say 'Help' on any voice recognition display and the help prompt for the display is played.

## Voice Recognition for the Radio

If browsing the audio sources when voice is touched, the voice recognition commands for AM, FM, and SiriusXM (if equipped) are available.

'Switch to AM': Switch bands to AM and tune to the last AM radio station.

'Switch to FM': Switch bands to FM and tune to the last FM radio station.

'Switch to SXM': Switch bands to SiriusXM and tune to the last SiriusXM channel.

'Tune to <AM frequency> AM': Tune to the radio station whose frequency is identified in the command (like 'nine fifty').

'Tune to <FM frequency> FM': Tune to the radio station whose frequency is identified in the command (like 'one oh one point one').

'Tune to <AM frequency> AM HD': Tune to the HD Radio station whose frequency is identified in the command.

'Tune to <FM frequency> FM HD': Tune to the HD Radio station whose frequency is identified in the command.

'Tune to <FM frequency> FM HD <HD channel number>': Tune to the HD Radio station whose frequency and HD channel are identified in the command.

'Tune to SXM <SXM channel number>': Tune to the SiriusXM radio station whose channel number is identified in the command.

'Tune to SXM <SXM channel name>': Tune to the SiriusXM radio station whose channel name is identified in the command.

## Handling Large Amounts of Media Content

It is expected that large amounts of media content will be brought into the vehicle. It may be necessary to handle large amounts of media content in a different way than smaller amounts of media. The system may limit the options of voice recognition by not allowing selection of files by voice at the highest level if the number of files exceeds the maximum limit.

Changes to voice commands due to media content limits are:

- · Files including other individual files of all media types such as songs, audiobook chapters, podcast episodes, and videos.
- · Album type folders including types such as albums and audiobooks.

There are no restrictions if the number of files and albums is fewer than 12,000. When the number of files connected to the system is between 12,000 and 24,000, the content cannot be accessed directly with one command like 'Play <song name>.'

The restriction is that the command 'Play Song' must be spoken first; the system will then ask for the song name. The reply command would be to say the name of the song to play.

Similar limits exist for album content. If there are more than 12,000 albums, but fewer than 24,000, the content cannot be accessed directly with one command like, 'Play <album name>.' The command 'Play Album' must first be spoken; the system will then ask for the album name. The reply would be to say the name of the album to play.

Once the number of files has exceeded approximately 24,000, there is no support for accessing the songs directly through voice commands. There will still be access to the media content by using commands for playlists, artists, and genres.

The access commands for playlists, artists, and genres are prohibited after the number of this type of media exceeds 12,000.

The system will provide feedback the first time voice recognition is initiated if it has become apparent that any of these limits are reached during a device initializing process.

Voice recognition performance will degrade to some extent based on many factors when adding large amounts of data to recognize. If this is the case, perhaps accessing songs through playlists or artist name would work better.

## Voice Recognition for Navigation

'Navigation': Begin a dialog to enter specific destination information.

'Navigation Commands': Begin a dialog to enter specific destination information.

'Address': Begin a dialog to enter a specific destination address, which includes the entire address consisting of the house number, street name, city, state/province, and country. Do not include the ZIP code.

'Place of Interest': Begin a dialog to enter a destination Place of Interest category or major brand name.

The name must be precisely spoken. Nicknames or short names for the businesses will not likely be found. Lesser known businesses might have to be located by category, such as fast food, hotels, or banks.

'Navigate to Contact': Begin a dialog to enter a specific destination contact name.

'Cancel Route':

End route guidance.

'Take Me Home': Create a route to a stored home location.

## Voice Recognition for the Phone

Move the slider knob (1) to change the direction of the airflow and to shut off the air flow. The horizontal vanes rotate up and down. A metallic click sounds every time they pass through the horizontal position.

## Operation Tips

- · Clear snow off the hood to improve visibility and help decrease moisture drawn into the vehicle.
- · Clear away any ice, snow, or leaves from the air inlets at the base of the windshield that could block the flow of air into the vehicle.
- · When you enter a vehicle in cold weather, press the fan up button to the maximum fan level before driving. This helps clear the intake ducts of snow and moisture, and reduces the chance of fogging the inside of the window.
- · Use of non-GM approved hood deflectors can adversely affect the performance of the system. Check with your dealer before adding equipment to the outside of the vehicle.
- · Keep the air path under the front seats clear of objects to help circulate the air inside of the vehicle more effectively.

## Rear System Air Vents

See your dealer if additional assistance is needed.

## Service

All vehicles have a label underhood that identifies the refrigerant used in the vehicle. The refrigerant system should only be serviced by trained and certified technicians. The

air conditioning evaporator should never be repaired or replaced by one from a salvage vehicle. It should only be replaced by a new evaporator to ensure proper and safe operation.

During service, all refrigerants should be reclaimed with proper equipment. Venting refrigerants directly to the atmosphere is harmful to the environment and may also create unsafe conditions based on inhalation, combustion, frostbite, or other health-based concerns.

The air conditioning system requires periodic maintenance. See Maintenance Schedule 3 426 .

## Driving Information

## Driving for Better Fuel Economy

Driving habits can affect fuel mileage. Here are some driving tips to get the best fuel economy possible:

- · Avoid fast starts and accelerate smoothly.
- · Set the climate controls to the desired temperature after the engine is started, or turn them off when not required.
- · Brake gradually and avoid abrupt stops.
- · When road and weather conditions are appropriate, use cruise control.
- · Avoid idling the engine for long periods of time.
- · Always follow posted speed limits or drive more slowly when conditions require.
- · Combine several trips into a single trip.
- · Keep vehicle tires properly inflated.
- · Replace the vehicle's tires with the same TPC Spec number molded into the tire's sidewall near the size.
- · Follow recommended scheduled maintenance.

## Distracted Driving

Distraction comes in many forms and can take your focus from the task of driving. Exercise good judgment and do not let other activities divert your attention away from the road. Many local governments have enacted laws regarding driver distraction. Become familiar with the local laws in your area.

To avoid distracted driving, keep your eyes on the road, keep your hands on the steering wheel, and focus your attention on driving.

- · Watch the road. Do not read, take notes, or look up information on phones or other electronic devices.
- · Do not use a phone in demanding driving situations. Use a hands-free method to place or receive necessary phone calls.
- · Designate a front seat passenger to handle potential distractions.
- · Become familiar with vehicle features before driving, such as programming favorite radio stations and adjusting climate control and seat settings. Program all trip information into any navigation device prior to driving.
- · Wait until the vehicle is parked to retrieve items that have fallen to the floor.
- · Keep pets in an appropriate carrier or restraint.
- · Stop or park the vehicle to tend to children.
- · Avoid stressful conversations while driving, whether with a passenger or on a cell phone.

## Warning

Taking your eyes off the road too long or too often could cause a crash resulting in injury or death. Focus your attention on driving.

Refer to the infotainment section for more information on using that system and the navigation system, if equipped, including pairing and using a cell phone.

## Defensive Driving

Defensive driving means 'always expect the unexpected.' The first step in driving defensively is to wear the seat belt. See Seat Belts 3 55 .

- · Assume that other road users (pedestrians, bicyclists, and other drivers) are going to be careless and make mistakes. Anticipate what they may do and be ready.
- · Focus on the task of driving.
- · Allow enough following distance between you and the driver in front of you.

## Impaired Driving

Death and injury associated with impaired driving is a global tragedy.

<!-- image -->

## Warning

Drinking alcohol or taking drugs and then driving is very dangerous. Your reflexes, perceptions, attentiveness, and judgment can be affected by even a small amount of alcohol or drugs. You can have a serious or even fatal - collision if you drive after drinking or taking drugs.

Do not drive while under the influence of alcohol or drugs, or ride with a driver who has been drinking or is impaired by drugs. Find alternate transportation home; or if you are with a group, designate a driver who will remain sober.

## Control of a Vehicle

Braking, steering, and accelerating are important factors in helping to control a vehicle while driving.

## Braking

Braking action involves perception time and reaction time. Deciding to push the brake pedal is perception time. Actually doing it is reaction time.

Average driver reaction time is about threequarters of a second. In that time, a vehicle moving at 100 km/h (60 mph) travels 20 m (66 ft), which could be a lot of distance in an emergency.

Helpful braking tips to keep in mind include:

- · Avoid needless heavy braking.
- · Keep enough distance between you and the vehicle in front of you.
- · Keep pace with traffic.

If the engine ever stops while the vehicle is being driven, brake normally but do not pump the brakes. Doing so could make the pedal harder to push down. If the engine stops, there will be some power brake assist but it will be

used when the brake is applied. Once the power assist is used up, it can take longer to stop and the brake pedal will be harder to push.

## Steering

## Caution

To avoid damage to the steering system, do not drive over curbs, parking barriers, or similar objects at speeds greater than 3 km/h (1 mph). Use care when driving over other objects such as lane dividers and speed bumps. Damage caused by misuse of the vehicle is not covered by the vehicle warranty.

<!-- image -->

## Electric Power Steering

The vehicle is equipped with an electric power steering system, which reduces the amount of effort needed to steer the vehicle. It does not have power steering fluid. Regular maintenance is not required.

If the vehicle experiences a system malfunction and loses power steering, greater steering effort may be required. Power steering assist also may be reduced if you turn the steering wheel as far as it can turn and hold it there with force for an extended period of time.

See your dealer if there is a problem.

## Curve Tips

- · Reduce speed before entering a curve.
- · Take curves at a reasonable speed.
- · Maintain a reasonable steady speed through the curve.
- · Wait until the vehicle is out of the curve before accelerating gently into the straightaway.

## Steering in Emergencies

- · Holding both sides of the steering wheel allows you to turn 180 degrees without removing a hand.
- · There are some situations when steering around a problem may be more effective than braking.
- · Antilock Brake System (ABS) allows steering while braking.

## Off-Road Recovery

<!-- image -->

The vehicle's right wheels can drop off the edge of a road onto the shoulder while driving. Follow these tips:

- 1. Ease off the accelerator and then, if there is nothing in the way, steer the vehicle so that it straddles the edge of the pavement.
- 2. Turn the steering wheel about one-eighth of a turn, until the right front tire contacts the pavement edge.
- 3. Turn the steering wheel to go straight down the roadway.

## Loss of Control

## Skidding

There are three types of skids that correspond to the vehicle's three control systems:

- · Steering or Cornering Skid - too much speed or steering in a curve causes tires to slip and lose cornering force.
- · Braking Skid - wheels are not rolling.
- · Acceleration Skid - too much throttle causes the driving wheels to spin.

Defensive drivers avoid most skids by taking reasonable care suited to existing conditions, and by not overdriving those conditions. But skids are always possible.

If the vehicle starts to slide, follow these suggestions:

- · Slow down and adjust your driving according to weather conditions. Stopping distance can be longer and vehicle control can be affected when traction is reduced by water, snow, ice, gravel, or other material
- · Ease your foot off the accelerator pedal and steer the way you want the vehicle to go. The vehicle may straighten out. Be ready for a second skid if it occurs.

on the road. Learn to recognize warning clues - such as enough water, ice, or packed snow on the road to make a mirrored surface - and slow down when you have any doubt.

- · Try to avoid sudden steering, acceleration, or braking, including reducing vehicle speed by shifting to a lower gear. Any sudden changes could cause the tires to slide.

Remember: Antilock brakes help avoid only the braking skid.

## Off-Road Driving

Four-wheel-drive vehicles can be used for offroad driving. Vehicles without four-wheel drive and vehicles not equipped with All Terrain (AT) or On-Off Road (OOR) tires must not be driven off-road except on a level, solid surface. For contact information about the original equipment tires, see the warranty manual. One of the best ways for successful off-road driving is to control the speed.

<!-- image -->

## Warning

When driving off-road, bouncing and quick changes in direction can easily throw you out of position. This could cause you to lose control and crash. You and your passengers should always wear seat belts.

## Before Driving Off-Road

- · Fuel the vehicle, fill fluid levels, and check inflation pressure in all tires, including the spare, if equipped.
- · Have all necessary maintenance and service work completed.
- · Read all the information about four-wheeldrive vehicles in this manual.
- · Know the local laws that apply to offroad driving.

## Loading the Vehicle for Off-Road Driving

<!-- image -->

## Warning

- · Unsecured cargo on the load floor can be tossed about when driving over rough terrain. You or your passengers can be struck by flying objects. Secure the cargo properly.
- · Heavy loads on the roof raise the vehicle's center of gravity, making it more likely to roll over. You can be seriously or fatally injured if the vehicle rolls over. Put heavy loads inside the cargo area, not on the roof.
- · Keep cargo in the cargo area as far forward and as low as possible. The heaviest things should be on the floor, forward of the rear axle.

For more information about loading the vehicle, see Vehicle Load Limits 3 218 and Tires 3 377 .

## Environmental Concerns

- · Do not damage shrubs, flowers, trees, or grasses or disturb wildlife.
- · Always use established trails, roads, and areas that have been set aside for public off-road recreational driving and obey all posted regulations.
- · Do not park over things that burn. See Parking over Things That Burn 3 227 .

## Driving on Hills

Driving safely on hills requires good judgment and an understanding of what the vehicle can and cannot do.

<!-- image -->

## Warning

Many hills are simply too steep for any vehicle. Driving up hills can cause the vehicle to stall. Driving down hills can cause loss of control. Driving across hills can cause a rollover. You could be injured or killed. Do not drive on steep hills.

Before driving on a hill, assess the steepness, traction, and obstructions. If the terrain ahead cannot be seen, get out of the vehicle and walk the hill before driving further.

## When driving on hills:

- · Maintain a slow speed.
- · Use a low gear and keep a firm grip on the steering wheel.
- · When possible, drive straight up or down the hill.
- · Slow down when approaching the top of the hill.

<!-- image -->

## Warning

Driving to the top of a hill at high speed can cause a crash. There could be a drop-off, embankment, cliff, or even another vehicle. You could be seriously injured or killed. As you near the top of a hill, slow down and stay alert.

- · Use headlamps even during the day to make the vehicle more visible.
- · Never go downhill forward or backward with either the transmission or transfer case in N (Neutral). The brakes could overheat and you could lose control.

<!-- image -->

## Warning

If the vehicle has the two-speed automatic or electronic transfer case, shifting the transfer case to N (Neutral) can cause your vehicle to roll even if the transmission is in P (Park). This is because the N (Neutral) position on the transfer case overrides the transmission. You or someone else could be injured. If leaving the vehicle, set the parking brake and shift the transmission to P (Park). Shift the transfer case to any position but N (Neutral).

- · When driving down a hill, keep the vehicle headed straight down. Use a low gear because the engine will work with the brakes to slow the vehicle and help keep the vehicle under control.

<!-- image -->

## Warning

Heavy braking when going down a hill can cause your brakes to overheat and fade. This could cause loss of control and you or others could be injured or killed. Apply the brakes lightly when descending a hill and use a low gear to keep vehicle speed under control.

- · Avoid turns that take the vehicle across the incline of the hill. Driving across an incline puts more weight on the downhill wheels, which could cause a downhill slide or a rollover.
- · Hidden obstacles can make the steepness of the incline more severe. If a rock is driven across with the uphill wheels, or if the downhill wheels drop into a rut or depression, the vehicle can tilt even more.
- · Loose gravel, muddy spots, or even wet grass can cause the tires to slip sideways, downhill. If the vehicle slips sideways, it can hit something and potentially roll over.

- · If an incline must be driven across, and the vehicle starts to slide, turn downhill. This should help straighten out the vehicle and prevent the side slipping.

## If the vehicle stalls on a hill:

- 1. Apply the brakes to stop the vehicle, and then apply the parking brake.
- 2. Shift into P (Park) and then restart the engine.
- · Never try to turn the vehicle around. If the hill is steep enough to stall the vehicle, it is steep enough to cause it to roll over.
- · If driving uphill when the vehicle stalls, shift to R (Reverse), release the parking brake, and back straight down.
- · If you cannot make it up the hill, back straight down the hill.
- · Never back down a hill in N (Neutral) using only the brake. The vehicle can roll backward quickly and you could lose control.
- · If driving downhill when the vehicle stalls, shift to a lower gear, release the parking brake, and drive straight down the hill.
- 3. If the vehicle cannot be restarted after stalling, set the parking brake, shift into P (Park), and turn the vehicle off.
- 3.1 Leave the vehicle and seek help.
- 3.2 Stay clear of the path the vehicle would take if it rolled downhill.

<!-- image -->

{

## Warning

Getting out of the vehicle on the downhill side when stopped across an incline is dangerous. If the vehicle rolls over, you could be crushed or killed. Always get out on the uphill side of the vehicle and stay well clear of the rollover path.

## Driving in Mud, Sand, Snow, or Ice

Use a low gear when driving in mud - the deeper the mud, the lower the gear. Keep the vehicle moving to avoid getting stuck.

Traction changes when driving on sand. On loose sand, such as on beaches or sand dunes, the tires tend to sink into the sand. This affects

steering, accelerating, and braking. Drive at a reduced speed and avoid sharp turns or abrupt maneuvers.

Traction is reduced on hard packed snow and ice and it is easy to lose control. Reduce vehicle speed when driving on hard packed snow and ice.

<!-- image -->

## Warning

Driving on frozen lakes, ponds, or rivers can be dangerous. Ice conditions vary greatly and the vehicle could fall through the ice; you and your passengers could drown. Drive your vehicle on safe surfaces only.

## Driving in Water

<!-- image -->

## Warning

Driving through rushing water can be dangerous. Deep water can sweep your vehicle downstream and you and your passengers could drown. If it is only shallow water, it can still wash away the ground from under your tires. Traction could be lost, and the vehicle could roll over. Do not drive through rushing water.

## Caution

Do not drive through standing water if it is deep enough to cover the wheel hubs, axles, or exhaust pipe. Deep water can damage the axle and other vehicle parts.

If the standing water is not too deep, drive through it slowly. At faster speeds, water can get into the engine and cause it to stall. Stalling can occur if the exhaust pipe is under water. Do not turn off the ignition when driving through water. If the exhaust pipe is under water, the engine will not start. When going through water, the brakes get wet and it may take longer to stop. See 'Driving on Wet Roads' later in this section.

## After Off-Road Driving

Remove any brush or debris that has collected on the underbody or chassis, or under the hood. These accumulations can be a fire hazard.

After operation in mud or sand, have the brake linings cleaned and checked. These substances can cause glazing and uneven braking. Check the body structure, driveline, steering,

suspension, wheels, tires, and exhaust system for damage and check the fuel lines and cooling system for any leakage.

More frequent maintenance service is required. See the Maintenance Schedule 3 426 .

## Driving on Wet Roads

Rain and wet roads can reduce vehicle traction and affect your ability to stop and accelerate. Always drive slower in these types of driving conditions and avoid driving through large puddles and deep-standing or flowing water.

<!-- image -->

## Warning

Wet brakes can cause crashes. They might not work as well in a quick stop and could cause pulling to one side. You could lose control of the vehicle.

After driving through a large puddle of water or a car/vehicle wash, lightly apply the brake pedal until the brakes work normally.

(Continued)

## Warning (Continued)

Flowing or rushing water creates strong forces. Driving through flowing water could cause the vehicle to be carried away. If this happens, you and other vehicle occupants could drown. Do not ignore police warnings and be very cautious about trying to drive through flowing water.

## Hydroplaning

Hydroplaning is dangerous. Water can build up under the vehicle's tires so they actually ride on the water. This can happen if the road is wet enough and you are going fast enough. When the vehicle is hydroplaning, it has little or no contact with the road.

There is no hard and fast rule about hydroplaning. The best advice is to slow down when the road is wet.

## Other Rainy Weather Tips

Besides slowing down, other wet weather driving tips include:

- · Pass with caution.
- · Allow extra following distance.

- · Keep windshield wiping equipment in good shape.
- · Have good tires with proper tread depth. See Tires 3 377 .
- · Keep the windshield washer fluid reservoir filled.
- · Turn off cruise control.

## Hill and Mountain Roads

Driving on steep hills or through mountains is different than driving on flat or rolling terrain. Tips include:

- · Check all fluid levels and brakes, tires, and cooling system.
- · Keep the vehicle serviced and in good shape.
- · Shift to a lower gear when going down steep or long hills.

<!-- image -->

## Warning

Using the brakes to slow the vehicle on a long downhill slope can cause brake overheating, can reduce brake

(Continued)

## Warning (Continued)

performance, and could result in a loss of braking. Shift the transmission to a lower gear to let the engine assist the brakes on a steep downhill slope.

<!-- image -->

## Warning

Coasting downhill in N (Neutral) or with the ignition off is dangerous. This can cause overheating of the brakes and loss of steering assist. Always have the engine running and the vehicle in gear.

- · Drive at speeds that keep the vehicle in its own lane. Do not swing wide or cross the center line.
- · Pay attention to special road signs (e.g., falling rocks area, winding roads, long grades, passing or no-passing zones) and take appropriate action.
- · Be alert on top of hills; something could be in your lane (e.g., stalled car, crash).

## Winter Driving

## Driving on Snow or Ice

## Caution

To avoid damage to the wheels and brake components, always clear snow and ice from inside the wheels and underneath the vehicle before driving.

Snow or ice between the tires and the road creates less traction or grip, so drive carefully. Wet ice can occur at about 0 °C (32 °F) when freezing rain begins to fall. Avoid driving on wet ice or in freezing rain until roads can be treated.

## For Slippery Road Driving:

- · Turn on Traction Control. See Traction Control/Electronic Stability Control 3 242 .
- · Accelerate gently. Accelerating too quickly causes the wheels to spin and makes the surface under the tires slick.
- · The Antilock Brake System (ABS) improves vehicle stability during hard stops, but the brakes should be applied sooner than when on dry pavement. See Antilock Brake System (ABS) 3 239 .
- · Allow greater following distance and watch for slippery spots. Icy patches can occur on otherwise clear roads in shaded areas. The surface of a curve or an overpass can remain icy when the surrounding roads are clear. Avoid sudden steering maneuvers and braking while on ice.
- · Turn off cruise control.

## Cold Weather Mode

In very low temperatures, a cold weather message may display on the Driver Information Center (DIC). The engine speed, transmission shift patterns, and cabin fan speed may operate differently to enable the vehicle to warm up quicker. You can manually override the cabin fan speed in cold weather mode.

## Blizzard Conditions

Stop the vehicle in a safe place and signal for help. Stay with the vehicle unless there is help nearby. If possible, use Roadside Assistance. See Roadside Assistance Program 3 443 . To get help and keep everyone in the vehicle safe:

- · Tie a red cloth to an outside mirror.
- · Turn on the hazard warning flashers.

<!-- image -->

## Warning

Snow can trap engine exhaust under the vehicle. This may cause exhaust gases to get inside. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide (CO), which cannot be seen or smelled. It can cause unconsciousness and even death.

If the vehicle is stuck in snow:

- · Open a window about 5 cm (2 in) on the vehicle side that is away from the wind, to bring in fresh air.
- · Clear snow from the base of the vehicle, especially any blocking the exhaust pipe.
- · Fully open the air outlets on or under the instrument panel.
- · Adjust the climate control system to circulate the air inside the vehicle and set the fan speed to the highest setting. See 'Climate Control Systems.'

For more information about CO, see Engine Exhaust 3 228 .

To save fuel, run the engine for short periods to warm the vehicle and then shut the engine off and partially close the window. Moving about to keep warm also helps.

If it takes time for help to arrive, when running the engine, push the accelerator pedal slightly so the engine runs faster than the idle speed. This keeps the battery charged to restart the vehicle and to signal for help with the headlamps. Do this as little as possible, to save fuel.

## If the Vehicle Is Stuck

Slowly and cautiously spin the wheels to free the vehicle when stuck in sand, mud, ice, or snow.

The Traction Control System (TCS) can often help to free a stuck vehicle. See Traction Control/Electronic Stability Control 3 242 .

If TCS cannot free the vehicle, turn TCS off and use the rocking method. See 'Rocking the Vehicle to Get it Out' following.

<!-- image -->

## Warning

If the vehicle's tires spin at high speed, they can explode, and you or others could be injured. The vehicle can overheat, causing an engine compartment fire or other damage. Spin the wheels as little as possible and avoid going above 56 km/h (35 mph).

## Rocking the Vehicle to Get it Out

Turn the steering wheel left and right to clear the area around the front wheels. Turn off any traction system. Shift back and forth between R (Reverse) and a low forward gear, spinning the wheels as little as possible. To prevent transmission wear, wait until the wheels stop spinning before shifting gears. Release the accelerator pedal while shifting, and press lightly on the accelerator pedal when the transmission is in gear. Slowly spinning the wheels in the forward and reverse directions causes a rocking motion that could free the vehicle. If that does not get the vehicle out after a few tries, it might need to be towed out. If the vehicle does need to be towed out, see Transporting a Disabled Vehicle 3 411 .

## Vehicle Load Limits

It is very important to know how much weight the vehicle can carry. This weight is called the vehicle capacity weight and includes the weight of all occupants, cargo, and all nonfactory-installed options. Two labels on the vehicle may show how much weight it was designed to carry, the Tire and Loading Information label and the Certification/Tire label.

<!-- image -->

## Warning

Do not load the vehicle any heavier than the Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (GVWR), or either the maximum front or rear Gross Axle Weight Rating (GAWR). This can cause systems to break and change the way the vehicle handles. This could cause loss of control and a crash. Overloading can also reduce stopping performance, damage the tires, and shorten the life of the vehicle.

## Tire and Loading Information Label

<!-- image -->

## Label Example

A vehicle specific Tire and Loading Information label is attached to the center pillar (B-pillar). The tire and loading information label shows the number of occupant seating positions (1), and the maximum vehicle capacity weight (2) in kilograms and pounds.

The Tire and Loading Information label also shows the size of the original equipment tires (3) and the recommended

cold tire inflation pressures (4). For more information on tires and inflation see Tires 3 377 and Tire Pressure 3 382 .

There is also important loading information on the vehicle Certification/ Tire label. It may show the Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (GVWR) and the Gross Axle Weight Rating (GAWR) for the front and rear axles. See 'Certification/Tire Label' later in this section.

'Steps for Determining Correct Load Limit-

- 1. Locate the statement "The combined weight of occupants and cargo should never exceed XXX kg or XXX lbs." on your vehicle's placard.
- 2. Determine the combined weight of the driver and passengers that will be riding in your vehicle.
- 3. Subtract the combined weight of the driver and passengers from XXX kg or XXX lbs.
- 4. The resulting figure equals the available amount of cargo and luggage load capacity. For example, if the "XXX"
- amount equals 1400 lbs. and there will be five 150 lb passengers in your vehicle, the amount of available cargo and luggage load capacity is 650 lbs. (1400-750 (5 x 150) = 650 lbs.)
- 5. Determine the combined weight of luggage and cargo being loaded on the vehicle. That weight may not safely exceed the available cargo and luggage load capacity calculated in Step 4.
- 6. If your vehicle will be towing a trailer, load from your trailer will be transferred to your vehicle. Consult this manual to determine how this reduces the available cargo and luggage load capacity of your vehicle.'

See Trailer Towing 3 315 for important information on towing a trailer, towing safety rules, and trailering tips.

<!-- image -->

## Example 1

- 1. Maximum Vehicle Capacity Weight for Example 1 = 453 kg (1,000 lbs)
- 2. Subtract Occupant Weight @ 68 kg (150 lbs) × 2 = 136 kg (300 lbs)
- 3. Available Occupant and Cargo Weight = 317 kg (700 lbs)

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Example 2

<!-- image -->

- 1. Vehicle Capacity Weight for Example 2 = 453 kg (1,000 lbs)
- 2. Subtract Occupant Weight @ 68 kg (150 lbs) × 5 = 136 kg (750 lbs)
- 3. Available Cargo Weight = 113 kg (250 lbs)

Example 3

- 1. Maximum Vehicle Capacity Weight for Example 3 = 453 kg (1,000 lbs)
- 2. Subtract Occupant Weight @ 91 kg (200 lbs) × 5 = 453 kg (1,000 lbs)
- 3. Available Cargo Weight = 0 kg (0 lbs)

Refer to the vehicle's Tire and Loading Information label for specific information about the vehicle's capacity weight and seating positions. The combined weight of the driver, passengers, and cargo should never exceed the vehicle's capacity weight.

## Label Example

A vehicle specific Certification/Tire label is attached to the B-pillar. The label may show the size of the vehicle's original tires and the inflation pressures needed to obtain the gross weight capacity of the vehicle. This is called Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (GVWR). The GVWR includes the weight of the vehicle, all occupants, fuel, and cargo.

The Certification/Tire label may also show the maximum weights for the front and rear axles, called Gross Axle Weight Rating

## Certification/Tire Label

(GAWR). To find out the actual loads on the front and rear axles, weigh the vehicle at a weigh station. Your dealer can help with this. Be sure to spread the load equally on both sides of the center line.

The warranty does not cover parts or components that fail because of overloading.

The label will help determine how much cargo and installed equipment the vehicle can carry.

Using heavier suspension components to get added durability might not change the weight ratings. Ask your dealer to help load the vehicle properly.

<!-- image -->

## Warning

Things you put inside the vehicle can strike and injure people in a sudden stop or turn, or in a crash.

- · Put things in the cargo area of the vehicle. Try to spread the weight evenly.

(Continued)

## Warning (Continued)

- · Never stack heavier things, like suitcases, inside the vehicle so that some of them are above the tops of the seats.
- · When you carry something inside the vehicle, secure it whenever you can.
- · Do not leave an unsecured child restraint in the vehicle.
- · Do not leave a seat folded down unless you need to.

There is also important loading information for off-road driving in this manual. See 'Loading the Vehicle for Off-Road Driving' under Off-Road Driving 3 211 .

## Add-On Equipment

There may be a limit on how many people can be inside the vehicle when carrying removable items. Be sure to weigh the vehicle before buying and installing the new equipment.

## Caution

Overloading the vehicle may cause damage. Repairs would not be covered by the vehicle warranty. Do not overload the vehicle.

Remember not to exceed the Gross Axle Weight Rating (GAWR) of the front or rear axle.

## Starting and Operating New Vehicle Break-In

## Caution

During the first 800 km (500 mi) of driving this vehicle, overall performance will benefit by following these break-in period recommendations:

- · Avoid exceeding the following engine speeds when accelerating or downshifting to slow or brake the vehicle:
- · Avoid full throttle starts and abrupt stops.
- Gasoline engines: 4000 rpm
- Diesel engines: 3000 rpm
- · Avoid making hard stops for the first 300 km (200 mi). Hard stops with new brake linings can result in premature wear and earlier replacement. Follow this guideline every time brake linings are replaced.

(Continued)

## Caution (Continued)

- · Do not tow a trailer. See Trailer Towing 3 315 for the trailer towing capabilities of the vehicle and more information.

After the break-in period, the engine speed and load can be gradually increased.

On new vehicles, the various mechanical and electrical systems adjust during the first 6,400 km (4,000 miles) of routine driving to provide optimal fuel economy and transmission shift performance.

Electrical systems will adapt and calibrate during the break-in period. A one-time occurrence of clicks and similar vehicle noises is normal during this process.

Normal driving charges the vehicle battery to achieve the best operation of the vehicle.

## Ignition Positions

<!-- image -->

Vehicles equipped with Keyless Access have pushbutton starting.

The Remote Key must be in the vehicle for the system to operate. If the pushbutton start is not working, the vehicle may be near a strong radio antenna signal causing interference to the Keyless Access system. See Remote Key Operation 3 7 .

To shift out of P (Park), the ignition must be on or in Service Mode, and the brake pedal must be applied.

<!-- image -->

## Warning

Turning off the vehicle while moving may cause loss of power assist in the brake and steering systems and disable the airbags. While driving, only shut the vehicle off in an emergency.

Stopping the Engine/LOCK/OFF (No Indicator Lights): When the vehicle is stopped, press ENGINE START/STOP once to turn the engine off.

If the vehicle is in P (Park), the ignition will turn off, and Retained Accessory Power (RAP) will remain active. See Retained Accessory Power (RAP) 3 226 .

If the vehicle is not in P (Park), the ignition will return to ON/RUN mode and display the message SHIFT TO PARK in the Driver Information Center (DIC). When the vehicle is shifted into P (Park), the ignition will turn off.

The vehicle may have an electric steering column lock. The lock is activated when the ignition is turned off and either front door is opened. A sound may be heard as the lock actuates or releases. The steering column lock may not release with the wheels turned off

center. If this happens, the vehicle may not start. Move the steering wheel from left to right while attempting to start the vehicle. If this does not work, the vehicle needs service.

If the vehicle must be shut off in an emergency:

- 1. Brake using a firm and steady pressure. Do not pump the brakes repeatedly. This may deplete power assist, requiring increased brake pedal force.
- 2. Shift the vehicle to N (Neutral). This can be done while the vehicle is moving. After shifting to N (Neutral), firmly apply the brakes and steer the vehicle to a safe location.
- 3. Come to a complete stop.
- 4. Hold the brake pedal down and shift to P (Park). The shift lever must be in P (Park) to turn the ignition off.
- 5. Continue to hold the brake pedal down.
- 6. Set the parking brake. See Electric Parking Brake 3 239 .
- 7. Press ENGINE START/STOP once to turn the ignition off.
- 8. Release the brake pedal.

If the vehicle cannot be pulled over, and must be shut off while driving, press and hold ENGINE START/STOP for longer than two seconds, or press twice in five seconds.

Accessory Mode (Amber Indicator Light): This mode allows some electrical accessories to be used when the engine is off.

With the ignition off, pressing the button one time without the brake pedal applied will place the ignition system in accessory mode.

The ignition will switch from accessory mode to off after five minutes to prevent battery rundown.

## Starting the Engine

If the vehicle has a diesel engine, see the Duramax diesel supplement.

## Caution

If you add electrical parts or accessories, you could change the way the engine operates. Any resulting damage would not be covered by the vehicle warranty. See Add-On Electrical Equipment 3 340 .

Shift the vehicle into P (Park) or N (Neutral). To restart the engine when the vehicle is already moving, use N (Neutral) only.

## Caution

Do not try to shift to P (Park) if the vehicle is moving. If you do, you could damage the transmission. Shift to P (Park) only when the vehicle is stopped.

## Starting Procedure

- 1. The remote key must be in the vehicle. Press ENGINE START/STOP with the brake pedal applied. When the engine begins cranking, let go of the button.

The idle speed will go down as the engine gets warm. Do not race the engine immediately after starting it. Operate the engine and transmission gently to allow the oil to warm up and lubricate all moving parts.

When the low fuel warning light is on and the FUEL LEVEL LOW message is displayed in the Driver Information Center (DIC), press the ENGINE START/STOP position to continue engine cranking.

## Caution

Cranking the engine for long periods of time, by trying to start the engine immediately after cranking has ended, can overheat and damage the cranking motor, and drain the battery. Wait at least 15 seconds between each try, to let the cranking motor cool down.

- 2. If the engine does not start after five to 10 seconds, especially in very cold weather (below -18 °C or 0 °F), it could be flooded with too much gasoline. Try pushing the accelerator pedal all the way to the floor and holding it there while pressing ENGINE START/STOP for up to a maximum of 15 seconds. Wait at least 15 seconds between each try, to allow the cranking motor to cool down. When the engine starts, let go of the button and accelerator. If the vehicle starts briefly but then stops again, do the same thing. This clears the extra gasoline from the engine. Do not race the engine immediately after starting it. Operate the engine and transmission gently until the oil warms up and lubricates all moving parts.

## Stop/Start System

If equipped and enabled, the Stop/Start system shuts off the engine to help conserve fuel. It has components designed for the increased number of starts.

If equipped, the transfer case controls are used to shift into and out of four-wheel drive.

To shift the transfer case, press the desired button. The graphic in the instrument cluster will flash while a shift is in progress. The graphic displayed will change to indicate the setting requested.

When the shift is complete the graphic will stop flashing. The DIC message turns off once the shift is complete. If the transfer case cannot complete a shift request, it will go back to its last chosen setting.

The settings are:

N (Neutral): Use only when the vehicle needs to be towed. See Recreational Vehicle Towing 3 412 and Transporting a Disabled Vehicle 3 411 .

- 2 m (Two-Wheel Drive High): Use for driving on most streets and highways. The front axle is not engaged. This setting provides the best fuel economy.

AUTO (Automatic Four-Wheel Drive): Use when road surface conditions are variable. When driving in AUTO, the front axle is engaged, and the vehicle's power is sent to the front and rear wheels automatically based on driving conditions. This setting provides slightly lower fuel economy than 2 m .

- 4 m (Four-Wheel Drive High): Use this position when extra traction is needed, such as when driving on snowy or icy roads, when offroading, or when plowing snow.
- 4 n (Four-Wheel Drive Low): This setting engages the front axle and delivers extra torque. Choose 4 n when driving off-road in deep sand, deep mud, or deep snow, and while climbing or descending steep hills. While driving in 4 n , keep vehicle speed below 72 km/ h (45 mph).

Shifting into 4 n will turn Traction Control and StabiliTrak/ESC off. See Traction Control/ Electronic Stability Control 3 242 .

## Shifts between 2 m , 4 m , and AUTO

Any of these shifts can be made at normal driving speed.

The actual 4x4 shift request is only made after the button is released. The 4x4 graphic will remain flashing until the shift request has completed. A DIC message displays to indicate that the 4x4 transfer case has been requested to shift to the new desired state.

Once the 4x4 shift has completed, the DIC message disappears, the 4x4 graphic stops flashing, and the current setting is indicated.

When a shift to 2 m is completed successfully while in P (Park), the parking brake will engage. To resume driving, shift the transmission to the desired gear and manually release the parking bake or press the accelerator pedal to begin driving. See Electric Parking Brake 3 239 .

If equipped, use 4 n , AUTO, or 4 m to provide additional traction when parking on a steep grade with poor traction such as ice, snow, mud, or gravel.

## Shifting Into 4 n

- 1. The ignition must be on and the vehicle must be stopped or moving less than 5 km/h (3 mph) with the transmission in N (Neutral). It is best for the vehicle to be moving 1.6 to 3.2 km/h (1 to 2 mph).
- 2. Press 4 n . The actual 4x4 shift request is only made after the button is released. The 4x4 graphic will remain flashing until the shift request has completed. A DIC message displays to indicate that the 4x4 transfer case has been requested to shift to the new desired state.

Once the 4x4 shift has completed, the DIC message disappears, the 4x4 graphic stops flashing and the current setting is indicated.

If vehicle speed is higher when shift request occurs, a DIC message displays. Reduce vehicle speed.

If the transmission is not in N (Neutral) when shift request occurs, a DIC message displays. The vehicle will allow 20 seconds for the shift to occur. After this time, a graphic in the instrument cluster will indicate that the transfer case is in 4 n .

## Caution

Shifting the transmission into gear before the requested mode indicator light has stopped flashing could damage the transfer case.

If the transmission is not shifted into N (Neutral) or the vehicle has not slowed to 5 km/h (3 mph) within 20 seconds, the transfer case will remain in its original state. This will be indicated in the instrument cluster.

With the vehicle moving less than 5 km/h (3 mph) and the transmission in N (Neutral), attempt the shift again.

## Shifting Out of 4 n

- 1. The vehicle must be stopped or moving less than 5 km/h (3 mph) with the transmission in N (Neutral) and the ignition on. It is best for the vehicle to be moving 1.6 to 3.2 km/h (1 to 2 mph).
- 2. Press 4 m , AUTO, or 2 m . The actual 4x4 shift request is only made after the button is released. The 4x4 graphic will remain

flashing until the shift request has completed. A DIC message displays to indicate the state of the request.

Once the 4x4 shift has completed, the DIC message disappears, the 4x4 graphic stops flashing, and the current setting is indicated.

- If vehicle speed is higher when shift request occurs, a DIC message displays. Reduce vehicle speed.

If the transmission is not in N (Neutral) when the shift request occurs, DIC messages will display. The vehicle will allow 20 seconds for this shift to occur. After this time, a graphic in the instrument cluster will indicate that the transfer case is in 4 n .

## Caution

Shifting the transmission into gear before the requested mode indicator light has stopped flashing could damage the transfer case.

If the transmission is not shifted into N (Neutral) or the vehicle has not slowed to 5 km/h (3 mph) within 20 seconds, the transfer case will remain in its original state. This will be indicated in the instrument cluster.

- 4. Apply the parking brake and/or brake pedal.
- 5. Press 2 m five times in 10 seconds until the N (Neutral) symbol starts flashing in the instrument cluster. When the shift is complete, the graphic stops flashing. If the parking brake and/or brake pedal is not applied within 20 seconds, the transfer case will remain in the original state.
- 6. If the transmission is not shifted into N (Neutral) or the vehicle has not slowed to 5 km/h (3 mph) within 20 seconds, the

transfer case will remain in its original state. This will be indicated in the instrument cluster.

## Shifting Out of N (Neutral)

To shift out of N (Neutral):

- 1. Turn the ignition on with the engine off. See Ignition Positions 3 222 .
- 2. Set the parking brake. See Electric Parking Brake 3 239 .
- 3. Shift the transmission to N (Neutral).
- 4. Shift the transfer case to 2 m . Transfer case shifts out of N (Neutral) can only be made into 2 m . When the shift to 2 m is complete, the graphic in the instrument cluster will stop flashing. If the transfer case cannot complete a shift, the graphic will return to the previously selected setting.

## Single Speed Transfer Case

<!-- image -->

If equipped, the transfer case controls are used to shift into and out of four-wheel drive.

To shift the transfer case, press the desired button. The graphic in the instrument cluster will flash while a shift is in progress. The graphic displayed will change to indicate the setting requested.

When the shift is complete the graphic will stop flashing. The DIC message turns off once the shift is complete. If the transfer case cannot complete a shift request, it will go back to its last chosen setting.

## The settings are:

- 2 m (Two-Wheel Drive High): Use for driving on most streets and highways. The front axle is not engaged. This setting provides the best fuel economy.
- 4 m (Four-Wheel Drive High): Use this setting when extra traction is needed, such as when driving on snowy or icy roads, when offroading, or when plowing snow.

## AUTO (Automatic Four-Wheel Drive)

Use when road surface conditions are variable. When driving in AUTO, the front axle is engaged, and the vehicle's power is sent to the front and rear wheels automatically based on driving conditions. This setting provides slightly lower fuel economy than 2 m .

## Shifts between 2 m , 4 m , and AUTO

Any of these shifts can be made at normal driving speed.

The actual 4x4 shift request is only made after the button is released. The 4x4 graphic will remain flashing until the shift request has completed. A DIC message displays.

Once the 4x4 shift has completed, the DIC message disappears, the 4x4 graphic stops flashing, and the current setting is indicated.

The actual 4x4 shift request is only made after the button is released. The 4x4 graphic will remain flashing until the shift request has completed.

A DIC message displays. Once the 4x4 shift has completed, the DIC message disappears, the 4x4 graphic stops flashing, and the current setting is indicated.

## Brakes

## Electric Brake Boost

Vehicles equipped with electric brake boost have hydraulic brake circuits that are electronically controlled when the brake pedal is applied during normal operation. The system performs routine tests and turns off within a few minutes after the vehicle is turned off. Noise may be heard during this time. If the brake pedal is pressed during the tests or when the electric brake boost system is off, a noticeable change in pedal force and travel may be felt. This is normal.

## Antilock Brake System (ABS)

The Antilock Brake System (ABS) helps prevent a braking skid and maintain steering while braking hard.

<!-- image -->

If there is a problem with ABS, this warning light stays on. See Antilock Brake System (ABS) Warning Light 3 118 .

ABS does not change the time needed to get a foot on the brake pedal and does not always decrease stopping distance. If you get too close to the vehicle ahead, there will not be enough time to apply the brakes if that vehicle suddenly slows or stops. Always leave enough room ahead to stop, even with ABS.

## Using ABS

Do not pump the brakes. Just hold the brake pedal down firmly. Hearing and feeling ABS operate is normal.

## Braking in Emergencies

ABS allows steering and braking at the same time. In many emergencies, steering can help even more than braking.

## Electric Parking Brake

<!-- image -->

The Electric Parking Brake (EPB) can be applied when the vehicle is on or off. If there is not enough electrical power, the EPB cannot be applied or released. To prevent draining the battery, avoid unnecessary repeated cycles of the EPB.

The system has a red EPB status light and an amber service EPB warning light. See Electric Parking Brake Light 3 118 and Service Electric Parking Brake Light 3 118 . There are also parking brake-related Driver Information Center (DIC) messages.

Before leaving the vehicle, check the red EPB status light to ensure that the parking brake is applied.

If a message displays on the DIC indicating the transmission is unable to shift soon, the service electric parking brake is on, and the EPB light flashes at the same time, the system must be reset. Start the vehicle, apply the EPB, and then release it. The message and light should turn off. See Electric Parking Brake Light 3 118 and Service Electric Parking Brake Light 3 118 .

## EPB Apply

To apply the EPB:

- 1. Be sure the vehicle is at a complete stop.
- 2. Press the EPB switch.

The red EPB status light will flash and then stay on once the EPB is fully applied. If the red EPB status light flashes continuously, then the EPB is only partially applied or there is a problem with the EPB. A DIC message will display. Release the EPB and try to apply it again. If the light does not come on, or keeps flashing, have the vehicle serviced. Do not drive the vehicle if the red EPB status light is flashing. See your dealer.

If the amber service EPB warning light is on, press the EPB switch. Continue to hold the switch until the red EPB status light remains on. If the amber service EPB warning light is on, see your dealer.

If the EPB is applied while the vehicle is moving, the vehicle will decelerate as long as the switch is pressed. If the switch is pressed until the vehicle comes to a stop, the EPB will remain applied.

The vehicle may automatically apply the EPB in some situations when the vehicle is not moving. This is normal, and is done to periodically check the correct operation of the EPB system, or as required by other safety functions that utilize the EPB.

If the EPB fails to apply, block the rear wheels to prevent vehicle movement.

## EPB Release

To release the EPB:

- 1. Turn the ignition on or to accessory mode.
- 2. Apply and hold the brake pedal.
- 3. Press the EPB switch momentarily.

The EPB is released when the red EPB status light is off.

If the amber service EPB warning light is on, release the EPB by pressing and holding the EPB switch. Continue to hold the switch until the red EPB status light is off. If either light stays on after release is attempted, see your dealer.

## Caution

Driving with the parking brake on can overheat the brake system and cause premature wear or damage to brake system parts. Make sure that the parking brake is fully released and the brake warning light is off before driving.

If you are towing a trailer and parking on a hill, see Driving Characteristics and Towing Tips 3 311 .

## Automatic EPB Release

The EPB automatically releases if the vehicle is running, placed into gear, and an attempt is made to drive. Avoid rapid acceleration when the EPB is applied to preserve parking brake lining life.

## Brake Assist

Brake Assist detects rapid brake pedal applications due to emergency braking situations and provides additional braking to activate the Antilock Brake System (ABS) if the brake pedal is not pushed hard enough to activate ABS normally. Minor noise, brake pedal pulsation, and/or pedal movement during this time may occur. Continue to apply the brake pedal as the driving situation dictates. Brake Assist disengages when the brake pedal is released.

## Hill Start Assist (HSA)

<!-- image -->

## Warning

Do not rely on the HSA feature. HSA does not replace the need to pay attention and drive safely. You may not hear or feel alerts or warnings provided by this system. Failure to use proper care when driving may result in injury, death, or vehicle damage. See Defensive Driving 3 209 .

When the vehicle is stopped on a grade, Hill Start Assist (HSA) temporarily prevents the vehicle from rolling in an unintended

direction during the transition from brake pedal release to accelerator pedal apply. The brakes release when the accelerator pedal is applied or automatically release after a few seconds. The brakes may also release under other conditions. Do not rely on HSA to hold the vehicle.

HSA is available when the vehicle is facing uphill in a forward gear, or when facing downhill in R (Reverse). The vehicle must come to a complete stop on a grade for HSA to activate.

## Automatic Vehicle Hold (AVH)

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## Warning

Do not rely on this feature. It does not replace the need to pay attention and drive safely. You may not hear or feel alerts or warnings provided by this system. Failure to use proper care when driving may result in injury, death, or vehicle damage.

When Automatic Vehicle Hold (AVH) is turned on and the vehicle is braked to a stop, AVH prevents the vehicle from moving during the transition from brake pedal release to accelerator pedal apply. The brakes release when the accelerator pedal is applied. The brakes may also release under other conditions. Do not rely on AVH to hold the vehicle.

If the accelerator pedal is not applied within a few minutes, the Electric Parking Brake (EPB) is applied. The parking brake will also apply if the driver door is opened or the driver seat belt is unfastened while AVH is holding the vehicle.

AVH can be turned on by pressing AUTO HOLD. The AVH light on the instrument panel will come on. The AVH light is lit green while AVH is actively holding the vehicle. See Automatic Vehicle Hold (AVH) Light 3 119 .

## Ride Control Systems

## Traction Control/Electronic Stability Control

## System Operation

The vehicle has a Traction Control System (TCS) and StabiliTrak/Electronic Stability Control (ESC). These systems help limit wheel spin and assist the driver in maintaining control, especially on slippery road conditions.

TCS activates if it senses any of the drive wheels are spinning or beginning to lose traction. When this happens, TCS applies the brakes to the spinning wheels and reduces engine power to limit wheel spin.

StabiliTrak/ESC activates when the vehicle senses a difference between the intended path and the direction the vehicle is actually traveling. StabiliTrak/ESC selectively applies braking pressure to one or more of the vehicle wheel brakes to assist the driver in keeping the vehicle on the intended path. Trailer Sway Control (TSC) is also on automatically when the vehicle is started. See Trailer Sway Control (TSC) 3 329 .

If cruise control is being used and traction control or StabiliTrak/ESC begins to limit wheel spin, cruise control will disengage. Cruise control may be turned back on when road conditions allow.

Both systems come on automatically when the vehicle is started and begins to move. The systems may be heard or felt while they are operating or while performing diagnostic checks. This is normal and does not mean there is a problem with the vehicle.

It is recommended to leave both systems on for normal driving conditions, but it may be necessary to turn TCS off if the vehicle gets stuck in sand, mud, ice, or snow. See If the Vehicle Is Stuck 3 217 and 'Turning the Systems Off and On' later in this section.

When the transfer case (if equipped) is in FourWheel Drive Low, the TCS and StabiliTrak/ESC are automatically disabled, g comes on, and the appropriate message will appear on the Driver Information Center (DIC).

<!-- image -->

The indicator light for both systems is to the right of the center stack and below the screen. This light will:

- · Flash when StabiliTrak/ESC is activated
- · Flash when TCS is limiting wheel spin
- · Turn on and stay on when either system is not working

See Traction Control System (TCS)/Electronic Stability Control Light 3 120 .

If either system fails to turn on or to activate, a message displays in the Driver Information Center (DIC), and d comes on and stays on to indicate that the system is inactive and is not assisting the driver in maintaining control. Adjust driving accordingly.

<!-- image -->

If d comes on and stays on:

- 1. Stop the vehicle.
- 2. Turn the engine off and wait 15 seconds.
- 3. Start the engine.

Drive the vehicle. If d comes on and stays on, see your dealer as soon as possible.

## Turning the Systems Off and On

## Caution

Do not repeatedly brake or accelerate heavily when TCS is off. The vehicle driveline could be damaged.

To turn Traction (TSC) or Stability (ESC) off and on, access the Traction and Stability screen from the Vehicle Information main screen in the infotainment system. See Vehicle Information 3 128 for instructions on navigating and selecting items.

Traction and Stability Screen

<!-- image -->

The current status of each system is displayed next to the Traction and Stability icons. To turn either system off or on, select or touch the Traction and Stability screen to access the Traction and Stability menu screen.

Traction and Stability Menu

<!-- image -->

To turn off TCS, select or touch the Traction virtual button on the screen. The traction off light i displays in the instrument cluster. See Traction Off Light 3 120 .

If TCS is limiting wheel spin when disabled, the system will not turn off until the wheels stop spinning.

To turn TCS back on, select or touch the Traction virtual button on the screen. The traction off light i displayed in the instrument cluster will turn off.

To turn StabiliTrak/ESC off, first turn off TCS to enable the Stability virtual button on the screen, then select or touch the Stability virtual button. The StabiliTrak/ESC off light g will display in the instrument cluster. See Electronic Stability Control (ESC) Off Light 3 121 .

To turn StabiliTrak/ESC back on, select or touch the Stability virtual button on the screen. StabiliTrak/ESC will turn on, but TCS will remain off.

TCS cannot be on when StabiliTrak/ESC is off. If both systems are turned off, selecting or touching the Traction virtual button will turn both systems back on.

StabiliTrak/ESC will automatically turn on if the vehicle exceeds 56 km/h (35 mph) and cannot be turned off again until speed is reduced. Traction control will remain off. Vehicles equipped with the four corner air suspension re-enable StabiliTrak/ESC at 32 km/h (20 mph).

The vehicle has a Trailer Sway Control (TSC) feature and a Hill Start Assist (HSA) feature. See Trailer Sway Control (TSC) 3 329 or Hill Start Assist (HSA) 3 241 .

Adding accessories can affect the vehicle performance. See Accessories and Modifications 3 343 .

## Driver Mode Control

Driver Mode Control (DMC) allows the driver to adjust the overall driving experience to better suit preference by adjusting multiple subsystems simultaneously. Drive mode availability and affected vehicle subsystems are dependent upon vehicle trim level, region, and optional features.

Tour will be the default mode at every ignition cycle. A unique and persistent indicator will be displayed in the instrument cluster for each mode.

Depending on trim level, Tour mode, Sport mode, Snow/Ice mode, Off-Road mode, Tow/ Haul mode, Terrain mode, My mode, and V mode may be available.

<!-- image -->

To activate each mode, press the MODE button on the instrument panel to the left of the steering wheel. To activate Terrain mode, press g button located next to the MODE button.

Tour Mode: Use this mode for normal city and highway driving to provide a smooth ride. This setting provides balance between comfort and handling. This is the standard/default mode. There is no persistent indicator in the instrument cluster for this mode.

8 Sport Mode: Use this mode where road conditions or personal preference demand a more controlled response. When in Sport mode the vehicle automatically down shifts. In this mode, the vehicle also monitors driving behaviors and automatically enables

Performance Shift Features when spirited driving is detected. These features maintain lower transmission gears to increase available engine braking and improve acceleration response. The vehicle resumes normal operation after a short period when no spirited driving is detected. The steering changes to provide more precise control. If the vehicle has Magnetic Ride Control, the suspension changes to provide better cornering performance.

V-Series only: Sport Mode will provide more torque to the rear wheels.

6 Snow/Ice Mode: Use this mode to improve vehicle acceleration on snow and ice covered roads. When active, Snow/Ice Mode adjusts acceleration to optimize traction on slippery surfaces. This can compromise the acceleration on dry asphalt. This feature is not intended for use when the vehicle is stuck in sand, mud, ice, snow, or gravel. If the vehicle becomes stuck, see If the Vehicle Is Stuck 3 217 .

V-Series only: If traction control is disabled when in Snow/Ice mode the transfer case and the electronic limited slip differential will operate in a more aggressive manner to provide maximum traction. Snow/Ice mode will provide more torque to the front wheels.

7 Off-Road Mode: Use this mode for off-road recreational driving. Off-Road mode should be used to improve driving at moderate speeds, on grass, gravel, dirt, unpaved roads, or snowcovered roads. The accelerator pedal is tuned for off-road use. If equipped with the following features, Off-Road mode modifies pedal mapping, ride height, and Traction Control System (TCS) performance. For more information on off-road driving, see Off-Road Driving 3 211 .

\_ Tow/Haul Mode: Use this mode when hauling heavy loads for increased performance and vehicle control. Tow/Haul Mode adjusts the transmission shift pattern, steering, and Electronic Stability Control (ESC) performance.

If the vehicle is turned off while in Tow/Haul mode and then restarted within four hours or less, it will remain active. Otherwise, the vehicle will start in Tour mode. Tow/Haul mode turns on trailer sway control.

If equipped with a diesel engine, exhaust braking is automatically activated when Tow/ Haul mode is selected. The system will command down shifts to reduce vehicle speed when the brake is applied. The normal tow/ haul shift pattern will return once the vehicle is on a low grade or when the accelerator

pedal is pressed. While in the Electronic Range Select (ERS) Mode (see Manual Mode 3 232 Manual Mode (V-Series) 3 233 ), grade braking is deactivated, allowing the driver to select a range, and limiting the highest gear available.

For more information on trailer weight specifications, see Towing Equipment 3 319 .

<!-- image -->

g Terrain Mode: Use this mode when traveling on very rough roads at very low speeds, such as a two-track or heavily rutted road. This mode can also be used for pulling a boat out of the water on a trailer. When in Terrain mode, the vehicle shifts automatically, but will hold a lower gear longer to maximize engine torque. This mode has a unique pedal map and transmission shift pattern for better control at lower speeds and over rough terrain. This mode modifies accelerator pedal mapping, transmission shift pattern, ride height, and Electronic Limited-Slip Differential (eSLD).

When the vehicle comes to a stop on an upward grade, automatic vehicle hold is engaged until the driver presses the accelerator pedal. Stop/Start and cruise control are disabled in Terrain mode.

Active Braking during lift throttle will be engaged. This feature automatically applies light braking to simulate heavy engine braking of four-wheel-drive low. It also applies light braking in D (Drive) until the vehicle is at idle speeds. In L1 and L2 light braking will typically bring the vehicle to a stop. Active Braking during lift throttle also reduces trailer braking.

Terrain mode automatically exits to Tour mode if the brake temperatures become too hot, electronic parking brake becomes inoperable, or the vehicle cannot perform braking or vehicle hold.

For more information on off-road driving, see Off-Road Driving 3 211 and Hill and Mountain Roads 3 216 .

## V Mode

If equipped, to activate V mode, press the V mode button on the center console.

<!-- image -->

## V Mode and My Mode

V mode and My mode is used to personalize everyday driving. This mode allows the driver to configure the vehicle system settings to their driving preferences. My mode will remain active every time the vehicle is started. To customize V mode or My mode, see 'Drive Mode Customization.'

## Launch Control (V-Series Only)

Launch Control is available within V mode only to allow high levels of vehicle acceleration in a straight line. Launch Control is a form of traction control that manages tire spin while launching the vehicle. This feature is intended for use during closed course race events where up to 97 km (60 mph) are desirable. Launch Control is only available when the following criteria are met:

- -V mode is selected.
- -The vehicle is not moving.
- -The steering wheel is pointing straight.
- -The brake pedal is firmly pressed to the floor, equivalent to a panic brake event.
- -The accelerator pedal is rapidly applied to wide open throttle. If the vehicle rolls due to wide open throttle, release the throttle, press the brake pedal more firmly, and reapply the accelerator to wide open throttle.

Launch Control will initially limit vehicle speed as rapidly applying the accelerator pedal to a wide open throttle. Allow the engine rpm to stabilize and wait for the traction control light to begin flashing - this

indicates that the vehicle is ready to launch. A smooth, quick release of the brake pedal, while maintaining the fully pressed accelerator pedal, will manage wheel slip.

After the first launch the system will learn what traction is available and adjust for repeated runs. Re-entering V mode will reset launch control targets to 100%. Launch Control is designed for a closed course race track and not intended for public roads. The system is not intended to compensate for lack of driver experience or familiarity with the race track.

## Drive Mode Customization

The vehicle is equipped to modify the following settings based on vehicle content. Through the center radio display, select Vehicle > Settings > Drive Mode Customization to customize and personalize My mode or V mode, or turn on or off Visualization.

These settings will be retained over each key cycle, and do not have to be reset each time the vehicle is started. The following settings may be available depending on region, trim level, and optional features.

Engine Sound: Engine sound settings adjust the volume of engine noise. Engine sound is quieter at lower settings and louder at higher settings.

Steering: Steering settings adjust the effort required to turn the steering wheel. Steering feel is less responsive at lower settings and more responsive at higher settings.

Suspension: Suspension settings adjust the stiffness of the shocks and / or springs. The ride is more comfortable at lower settings and stiffer at higher settings for better control. Engine Shift: Engine shift settings adjust the throttle response, gear shifting, and engine performance. Throttle response increases at higher settings and gear shifting is more aggressive.

Brake Response: Brake response settings adjust the brake pedal response. Brake pedal feel is less sensitive at lower settings and more sensitive at higher settings.

All-Wheel Drive (AWD): AWD settings adjust the driveline system. Each setting is tuned for optimal driving and handling performance in different road conditions.

## Magnetic Ride Control

This vehicle may have a semi-active damping system called Magnetic Ride Control. With this feature, improved vehicle ride and handling is provided under a variety of passenger and loading conditions.

## Locking Rear Axle

Vehicles with a locking rear axle can give more traction on snow, mud, ice, sand, or gravel. It works like a standard axle most of the time, but when traction is low, this feature will allow the rear wheel with the most traction to move the vehicle.

## Four Corner Air Suspension System

The Four Corner Air Suspension feature provides full time load leveling capability along with the benefit of adjusting ride height for increased convenience and capability.

<!-- image -->

## Warning

To help avoid personal injury or death, make sure the area underneath the vehicle and inside the wheel wells is clear when lowering the vehicle.

<!-- image -->

## Warning

To help avoid personal injury or death, always select the lowest ride height for the current driving conditions. Higher ride heights raise the vehicle's center of gravity, increasing the chance of a rollover during extreme maneuvers.

<!-- image -->

## Warning

Heavy loads on the roof rack will make the vehicle's center of gravity higher, increasing the possibility of a rollover. To avoid losing control of the vehicle, always select the normal height setting and avoid high speeds, sudden starts, sharp turns, sudden braking, or abrupt maneuvers when carrying cargo on the roof rack.

## Changing Ride Height

<!-- image -->

Press either 'Up' or 'Down' Ride Height Button to open the Ride Height menu. Use these buttons to select the desired ride height in the menu. After a brief pause, the menu will timeout and the selection will finalize. Ride heights that are unavailable for selection will be greyed out in the menu.

## Ride Height Descriptions Normal Height

Normal Height is the standard vehicle height used for everyday driving.

## Entry/Exit Height

Entry/Exit Height is 50 mm (2 in) lower than Normal Height. This ride height lowers the vehicle for easy entry and exit from the vehicle as well as providing a lower height for loading and unloading cargo from any door or the rear liftgate.

This ride height can be selected in the Ride Height Menu at any vehicle speed. When Entry/Exit Height is select at higher speeds, the vehicle will wait to lower until the vehicle slows to less than 12 km/h (7 mph).

The vehicle will automatically raise to Normal Height from Entry/Exit Height when speed increases above 8 km/h (5 mph). If no door has been opened since lowering to Entry/Exit Height, the vehicle will wait to raise to Normal Height until 30 km/h (19 mph). This gives the driver more flexibility when lowering to Entry/ Exit Height for passenger pick up and drop off.

The driver can enable Automatic Entry/Egress Mode to automatically lower to Entry/Exit Height when the vehicle is shifted to P (PARK). Automatic Entry/Egress Mode may be enabled via the infotainment screen under Settings/ Vehicle/Ride Height. When the vehicle is higher than Normal Height, Automatic Entry/Egress Mode is disabled. When the vehicle is in Tow/

Haul Driver Mode, Off-Road Driver Mode, or it senses a trailer is connected, Automatic Entry/ Egress Mode is disabled.

## Increased Height

Increased Height is 25 mm (1 in) higher than Normal Height. This ride height raises the vehicle for off-road use, allows for higher speeds than Maximum Height, and is only available with specific optional content.

Increased Height can be selected in the Ride Height Menu while vehicle speed is less than 80 km/h (50 mph). If vehicle speed exceeds 80 km/h (50 mph), the vehicle will automatically lower to Normal Height.

Off-Road Driver Mode and Terrain Driver Mode will automatically set Increased Height when vehicle speed is less than 80 km/h (50 mph). If vehicle speed exceeds 80 km/h (50 mph), the vehicle will lower to Normal Height. Normal Height will be maintained until vehicle speed is slowed to less than 16 km/h (10 mph) and then the vehicle will automatically raise back to Increased Height.

The vehicle will automatically lower from Increased Height to Normal Height to provide improved stability if aggressive maneuvers are detected.

## Maximum Height

Maximum Height is 50 mm (2 in) higher than Normal Height. This ride height raises the vehicle for off-road use and is only available with specific optional content.

To raise the vehicle to Maximum Height, first shift the transfer case to 4 n . Once the transfer case is in 4 n and vehicle speed is less than 48 km/hr (30 mph), select Maximum Height in the Ride Height Menu. If vehicle speed exceeds 48 km/h, the vehicle will automatically lower to Increased Height.

The vehicle will automatically lower from Maximum Height to Normal Height to provide improved stability if aggressive maneuvers are detected.

## Aerodynamic Height

Aerodynamic Height is 20 mm (0.75 in) lower than Normal Height. This ride height lowers the vehicle at higher vehicle speeds to improve aerodynamics.

The vehicle will lower to Aerodynamic Height when vehicle speed exceeds 105 km/h (65 mph) for a period of time. The vehicle will raise to Normal Height when the vehicle slows to less than 48 km/h (30 mph).

Aerodynamic Height is automatically disabled when a trailer is connected to the vehicle or Tow/Haul Driver Mode is active.

## Lowered Height (V-Series Only)

Lowered Height is 20 mm (0.75 in) lower than Normal Height. This ride height lowers the vehicle to enhance handling and is only available with specific optional content.

V Mode will automatically set Lowered Height when enabled. See Driver Mode Control 3 244 .

## Suspension Modes

The air suspension has two special modes, Service Mode and Alignment Mode, located in the infotainment screen under Settings/ Vehicle/Suspension.

## Service Mode

Service Mode will disable all air suspension operation including raising and lowering the vehicle and operation of the air compressor. This mode is useful when the vehicle is being towed on a flat bed or when any work under the vehicle is being performed.

Service Mode is automatically enabled when the vehicle is put on a hoist or a floor jack is used to raise a corner. Service Mode automatically disables when vehicle speed exceeds 16 km/h (10 mph).

## Alignment Mode

Alignment Mode will optimize the vehicle height to provide the most accurate wheel alignment. This mode should be enabled once the vehicle is driven onto the alignment station.

To enable Alignment Mode, ensure the vehicle is at Normal Height and shift the vehicle to Neutral. Alignment Mode automatically disables when vehicle speed exceeds 16 km/h (10 mph).

## Air Suspension Operation with Door(s) or Hood Open

The air suspension will temporarily suspend all height changes while the hood or any door is open. The air suspension resumes height changes once the hood and all doors are closed. An open rear liftgate does not suspend the air suspension operation.

## System Over-Temperature

If the air suspension is under heavy use, the system may temporarily suspend all height changes to allow compressor cooldown. When this occurs and a height change is requested, a 'Leveling System Unavailable' message will be displayed in the instrument cluster.

## Suspension Lowered for Stability

In the event of a loss of Electronic Stability Control, the air suspension will lower the vehicle at higher speeds to provide increased stability. This will be accompanied by a 'Vehicle Lowering for Stability' message in the instrument cluster.

## Excessive Vehicle Loading

If the air suspension detects excessive vehicle loading, it will not raise above Normal Height.

## Air Suspension Service

If a 'Service Leveling System' message is displayed in the instrument cluster, see your authorized dealer immediately.

## Cruise Control

If equipped, cruise control allows the vehicle to maintain a set speed of 40 km/h (25 mph) or more without active acceleration. Cruise control does not work at speeds below 40 km/h (25 mph).

<!-- image -->

## Warning

Cruise control can be dangerous where you cannot drive safely at a steady speed. Do not use cruise control on winding roads or in heavy traffic.

Cruise control can be dangerous on slippery roads. On such roads, fast changes in tire traction can cause excessive wheel slip, and you could lose control. Do not use cruise control on slippery roads.

Cruise control will disengage if:

- · TCS or StabiliTrak/ESC is turned off.
- · The Traction Control System (TCS) or StabiliTrak/Electronic Stability Control (ESC) system begins to limit wheel spin. See Traction Control/Electronic Stability Control 3 242 .
- · A collision alert occurs. See Forward Collision Alert (FCA) System 3 292 .

When road conditions allow cruise control to be safely used, cruise control can be turned back on.

- · The brakes are applied.

<!-- image -->

5 : Press to turn cruise control on or off. The cruise control indicator light 5 is lit white on the instrument cluster when cruise control is turned on.

RES+: If there is a set speed in memory, press the thumbwheel up briefly and release it to resume cruise control at that speed or press and hold to accelerate. If cruise control is already engaged, use to increase the vehicle speed.

SET-: Press the thumbwheel down briefly to choose the set speed and engage cruise control. If cruise control is already engaged, use to decrease the vehicle speed.

* : Press to disengage cruise control without erasing the set speed from memory.

To choose the set speed and engage cruise control:

- 1. Press 5 .
- 2. Accelerate to the desired cruise speed.
- 3. Briefly press and release the thumbwheel down to SET-.
- 4. Remove your foot from the accelerator pedal.

When cruise control is engaged, the cruise control indicator light is lit green on the instrument cluster. See Instrument Cluster 3 108 .

## Resuming a Set Speed

If cruise control is engaged and then the brakes are applied or * is pressed, cruise control is disengaged without erasing the set speed from memory.

Once the vehicle reaches about 40 km/h (25 mph) or more, briefly press the thumbwheel up to RES+ to engage cruise control at the previous set speed.

## Increasing Speed While Using Cruise Control

If cruise control is already engaged:

- · To increase the vehicle speed in small increments, briefly press the thumbwheel up to RES+ and then release it. For each press, the vehicle speed increases by 1 km/ h (1 mph).
- · Press and hold the thumbwheel up to RES+ until the desired cruise speed is reached, then release it.

The speedometer reading can be displayed in either English or metric units. See Instrument Cluster 3 108 . The increment value used depends on the units displayed.

Reducing Speed While Using Cruise Control If cruise control is already engaged:

- · Press and hold the thumbwheel down to SET- until the desired lower cruise speed is reached, then release it.
- · To decrease the vehicle speed in small increments, briefly press the thumbwheel down to SET- and then release it. For each press, the vehicle speed decreases by 1 km/ h (1 mph).

## Passing Another Vehicle While Using Cruise Control

Use the accelerator pedal to increase the vehicle speed. When you take your foot off of the accelerator pedal, the vehicle will slow down to the previously set cruise speed. While pressing the accelerator pedal or shortly following the release to override cruise control, briefly pressing the thumbwheel down to SET- will result in cruise control being set to the current vehicle speed.

## Using Cruise Control on Hills

How well cruise control works on a hill depends on the vehicle speed, load, and the steepness of the hill. When driving up a steep hill, you may need to use the accelerator pedal to maintain the vehicle speed.

When driving downhill, Cruise Grade Braking assists in maintaining the cruise control set speed by using the engine and the transmission to slow down the vehicle. Cruise Grade Braking is enabled when the vehicle is on and cruise control is engaged. Cruise Grade Braking is not enabled in Range Selection Mode.

For other forms of descent control, see Automatic Transmission 3 229 and the section 'Tow/Haul Mode' under Driver Mode Control 3 244 .

## Ending Cruise Control

There are four ways to end cruise control:

- · Press * .
- · Press the brake pedal.
- · Press 5 .
- · Shift the transmission to N (Neutral).

## Erasing Speed Memory

The cruise control set speed is erased from memory if 5 is pressed or when the vehicle is turned off.

## Adaptive Cruise Control (Advanced)

If equipped, Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) allows you to select the cruise control set speed and the following gap. Read this entire section before using this system. The following gap is the following time (or distance) between your vehicle and a vehicle detected directly ahead in your path, moving in the same direction. If no vehicle is detected in your path, ACC works like regular cruise control. ACC uses camera and radar sensors to detect other vehicles. See Radio Frequency Statement 3 448 .

If a vehicle is detected in your path, ACC can speed up the vehicle or apply limited, moderate braking to maintain the selected following gap. You can disengage ACC at any time by pressing the brake pedal. If the Traction Control System (TCS) or StabiliTrak/Electronic Stability Control (ESC) activates while ACC is active, ACC may automatically disengage. See Traction Control/ Electronic Stability Control 3 242 . When road conditions allow ACC to be safely used, ACC can be turned back on.

Disabling the TCS or StabiliTrak/ESC system will disengage and prevent the engagement of ACC.

ACC can reduce the need for you to frequently brake and accelerate, especially when used on expressways, freeways, and interstate highways. When used on other roads, you may need to take over the control of braking or acceleration more often.

<!-- image -->

## Warning

ACC has limited braking ability and may not have time to slow the vehicle down enough to avoid a collision with another vehicle you are following. This can occur when vehicles suddenly slow or stop ahead, or enter your lane. Also see 'Alerting the Driver' later in this section. Complete attention is always required while driving and you should be ready to take action and apply the brakes. See Defensive Driving 3 209 .

<!-- image -->

## Warning

ACC will not detect or brake for children, pedestrians, animals, or other objects. Do not use ACC when:

## Warning (Continued)

- · On winding and hilly roads or when the sensors are blocked by snow, ice, or dirt. The system may not detect a vehicle ahead. Keep the entire front of the vehicle clean.
- · On slippery roads where fast changes in tire traction can cause excessive wheel slip.
- · Visibility is poor due to rain, snow, fog, dirt, insect residue, or dust; when other foreign objects obscure the camera and/or radar; or when the vehicle in front or oncoming traffic causes additional environmental obstructions, such as road spray. ACC performance is limited under these conditions.

<!-- image -->

The ACC indicator light \ displays on the instrument cluster and the Head-Up Display (HUD), if equipped. When ACC is turned on, the indicator is lit white. When ACC is active, the indicator is lit green.

Be mindful of speed limits, surrounding traffic speeds, and weather conditions when selecting the set speed.

## Resuming a Set Speed

If ACC is set at a desired speed and then the brakes are applied or * is pressed, ACC is disengaged without erasing the set speed from memory.

To begin using ACC again, briefly press the thumbwheel up to RES+ and release it:

- · If the vehicle is stopped with the brake pedal applied, press the thumbwheel up to RES+ and release the brake pedal. ACC will hold the vehicle until RES+ or the accelerator pedal is pressed.
- · If the vehicle is moving more than 5 km/h (3 mph), ACC returns to the previous set speed.

The ACC indicator light is lit green and the set speed displays on the instrument cluster. The vehicle ahead indicator light may be flashing if a vehicle ahead was present and moved. See 'Approaching and Following a Vehicle' later in this section.

Once ACC has resumed, the vehicle speed will increase to the set speed under the following conditions:

- · The vehicle ahead is beyond the selected following gap.
- · There is no vehicle ahead.
- · The vehicle speed is not being limited because of a sharp turn.

## Increasing Speed While ACC is at a Set Speed

If ACC is already activated, do one of the following:

- · Press and hold the thumbwheel up to RES+ until the desired set speed is displayed, then release it.
- · Use the accelerator pedal to accelerate to the desired higher cruise speed. Briefly press and release the thumbwheel down to SET- and release the accelerator pedal. The vehicle will now cruise at the higher set speed. When the accelerator pedal is pressed, ACC will not brake because you are overriding ACC. While overridden, the ACC indicator light is lit blue on the instrument cluster and the HUD, if equipped.
- · To increase the vehicle speed in smaller increments, briefly press the thumbwheel up to the first position for RES+ and release it. For each press, the vehicle speed increases by 1 km/h (1 mph).
- · To increase the vehicle speed in larger increments, press and hold the thumbwheel up to the second position for

RES+. While holding the thumbwheel up to the second position for RES+, the vehicle speed increases to the next 5 km/h (5 mph) mark on the speedometer, then continues to increase by 5 km/h (5 mph) while holding the thumbwheel.

The set speed can also be increased while the vehicle is stopped:

- · If ACC is holding the vehicle at a stop and there is another vehicle directly ahead, pressing the thumbwheel up to RES+ will increase the set speed.
- · If stopped with the brake pedal applied, press the thumbwheel up to RES+ until the desired set speed is displayed.
- · Pressing the thumbwheel up to RES+ will resume ACC only when there is no longer a vehicle ahead or the vehicle ahead is pulling away and the brake pedal is not applied.

When it is determined that there is no vehicle ahead or the vehicle ahead is beyond the selected following gap, then ACC will increase the vehicle speed to the set speed.

## Reducing Speed While ACC is at a Set Speed

If ACC is already activated, do one of the following:

- · To decrease the vehicle speed in smaller increments, briefly press and release the thumbwheel down to the first position for SET- and release it. For each press, the vehicle speed decreases by 1 km/h (1 mph).
- · Use the brake pedal to slow down to the desired lower cruise speed. Release the brake pedal and briefly press and release the thumbwheel down to SET- and release it. The vehicle will now cruise at the lower set speed.
- · To decrease the vehicle speed in larger increments, press and hold the thumbwheel down to the second position for SET-. While holding the thumbwheel down to the second position for SET-, the vehicle speed decreases to the next 5 km/h (5 mph) mark on the speedometer, then continues to decrease by 5 km/h (5 mph) while holding the thumbwheel.

The set speed can also be decreased while the vehicle is stopped. If stopped with the brake applied, press or hold the thumbwheel down to SET- until the desired set speed is displayed, then release it.

## Selecting the Follow Distance Gap

When a slower moving vehicle is detected ahead within the selected following gap, ACC will adjust the vehicle's speed and attempt to maintain the selected following gap distance.

When ACC is active, press [ on the steering wheel to adjust the following gap. Each press cycles through the three available settings: Far, Medium, or Near.

Pressing [ briefly displays the current following gap setting on the instrument cluster and the HUD, if equipped. The following gap setting is maintained until you change it.

Far Gap Setting

<!-- image -->

Medium Gap Setting

<!-- image -->

Near Gap Setting

<!-- image -->

If equipped, and a trailer is electrically connected, a trailer symbol is displayed with the following gap setting.

Far Gap Setting with Trailer

<!-- image -->

Medium Gap Setting with Trailer

<!-- image -->

Near Gap Setting with Trailer

<!-- image -->

Since each following gap setting corresponds to a following time (Far, Medium, or Near), the following distance will vary based on the vehicle speed. The higher the vehicle speed, the further back your vehicle will follow a vehicle that is detected ahead. Consider traffic and weather conditions when selecting the

following gap setting. The range of selectable gaps may not be appropriate for all drivers and driving conditions.

Changing the following gap setting automatically changes the alert timing sensitivity (Far, Medium, or Near) for the Forward Collision Alert (FCA) feature. See Forward Collision Alert (FCA) System 3 292 .

## Courtesy Gap

Press and hold [ on the steering wheel when your vehicle is moving to temporarily increase the following gap distance with the vehicle ahead to allow for merging traffic.

Press and hold [ when your vehicle is stopped to cancel ACC from resuming automatically, if the stop is brief, and to remain stationary. This can be used to allow traffic to merge between your vehicle and the vehicle ahead. When ready to resume ACC, press the thumbwheel up to RES+ or press the accelerator pedal.

ACC will return to maintaining the selected following gap after holding the vehicle.

## Alerting the Driver

With Head-Up Display

<!-- image -->

## Without Head-Up Display

While ACC is active, driver action may be required when ACC cannot apply sufficient braking because your vehicle is approaching a vehicle ahead too rapidly.

When this condition occurs, the collision alert symbol will flash on the windshield, or on the HUD, if equipped. Either eight beeps will sound from the front, or both sides of the Safety Alert Seat will pulse five times. To view available

alert settings from the infotainment home screen, touch Settings > Vehicle > Collision/ Detection Systems.

See Defensive Driving 3 209 .

## Approaching and Following a Vehicle

<!-- image -->

The vehicle ahead indicator light is displayed in the instrument cluster and the HUD, if equipped. The vehicle ahead indicator light only displays when a vehicle is detected in your vehicle's path and is moving in the same direction. If this indicator light is not displaying, ACC will not respond to, or brake for, vehicles ahead.

ACC automatically slows the vehicle down and adjusts vehicle speed to follow a detected vehicle ahead at the selected following gap. The vehicle speed increases or decreases to follow a detected vehicle in front of your vehicle when that vehicle is traveling slower than your vehicle's ACC set speed. When active, ACC may apply limited braking, if necessary.

When braking is active, the brake lamps will come on. The automatic braking may feel or sound different than if the brakes were applied manually. This is normal.

## Passing a Vehicle While Using ACC

If the set speed is high enough, and the left turn signal is used to pass a vehicle ahead in the selected following gap, ACC may assist by gradually accelerating the vehicle prior to the lane change.

<!-- image -->

## Warning

When using ACC to pass a vehicle or perform a lane change, the following distance to the vehicle being passed may be reduced. ACC may not apply sufficient acceleration or braking when passing a vehicle or performing a lane change. Always be ready to manually accelerate or brake to complete the pass or lane change.

## Stationary or Very Slow-Moving Objects

<!-- image -->

## Warning

ACC may not detect and react to stopped or slow-moving vehicles ahead of you. For example, the system may not brake for a vehicle it has never detected moving. This can occur in stop-and-go traffic or when a vehicle suddenly appears due to a vehicle ahead changing lanes. Your vehicle may not stop and could cause a crash. Use caution when using ACC. Your complete attention is always required while driving and you should be ready to take action and apply the brakes.

## Irregular Objects Affecting ACC

ACC may have difficulty detecting the following objects:

- · Non-standard shaped vehicles, such as vehicle transport, vehicles with a side car fitted, or horse carriages.
- · Vehicles with cargo extending from the back end.
- · Objects that are close to the front of your vehicle.

## ACC Automatically Disengages

ACC may automatically disengage and the driver will need to manually apply the brakes to slow the vehicle if:

- · The TCS or StabiliTrak/ESC system has activated or been disabled.
- · The sensors are blocked.
- · There is a fault in the system.
- · A DIC message may display to indicate that ACC is temporarily unavailable.
- · The radar falsely reports blockage when driving in a desert or remote area with no other vehicles or roadside objects.

The ACC indicator light will be lit white when ACC is no longer active.

In some cases, when ACC is temporarily unavailable, regular cruise control may be used. See 'Switching Between ACC and Regular Cruise Control' previously in this section. Always consider driving conditions before using either cruise control system.

## Notification to Resume ACC

While active, ACC will maintain a following gap distance behind a detected vehicle and can slow your vehicle speed to a stop behind that vehicle.

If the stopped vehicle ahead has driven away and ACC has not resumed, the vehicle ahead indicator light will flash in the instrument cluster as a reminder to check traffic ahead before proceeding. In addition, the left and right sides of the Safety Alert Seat will pulse three times, or three beeps will sound. To view available settings, from the infotainment home screen, touch Settings > Vehicle > Collision/Detection Systems, then touch 'Alert Type' or 'Adaptive Cruise Go Notifier.'

If equipped with the Driver Attention System (DAS), located on top of the steering column, when the vehicle ahead drives away, and DAS determines that the driver's attention is on the road ahead, ACC resumes automatically. See 'Attention to the Road' under Super Cruise 3 262 .

If necessary, briefly press the thumbwheel up to RES+ and release it, or press the accelerator pedal to resume ACC. If stopped for more than two minutes or if the driver door is opened and the driver seat belt is unbuckled, ACC

automatically applies the Electric Parking Brake (EPB) to hold the vehicle. The EPB status light will turn on. See Electric Parking Brake 3 239 . To release the EPB, press the accelerator pedal.

A DIC warning message may display indicating to shift to P (Park) before exiting the vehicle. See Vehicle Messages 3 131 .

<!-- image -->

## Warning

If ACC has stopped the vehicle, and if ACC is disengaged, turned off, or canceled, the vehicle will no longer be held at a stop. The vehicle can move. When ACC is holding the vehicle at a stop, always be prepared to manually apply the brakes.

<!-- image -->

## Warning

Leaving the vehicle without placing it in P (Park) can be dangerous. Do not leave the vehicle while it is being held at a stop by ACC. Always place the vehicle in P (Park) and turn off the ignition before leaving the vehicle.

## ACC Override

If using the accelerator pedal while ACC is active, the ACC indicator light displays blue on the instrument cluster and the HUD, if equipped, to indicate that automatic braking will not occur. ACC will resume operation when you release the accelerator pedal.

<!-- image -->

## Warning

The ACC will not automatically apply the brakes if your foot is resting on the accelerator pedal. You could crash into a vehicle ahead of you.

## Curves in the Road

<!-- image -->

## Warning

On curves, ACC may not detect a vehicle ahead in your lane. You could be startled if the vehicle accelerates up to the set speed, especially when following a vehicle exiting or entering exit ramps. You could lose control of the vehicle or crash. Do not use ACC while driving on an entrance or exit ramp. Always be ready to use the brakes if necessary.

<!-- image -->

## Warning

On curves, ACC may respond to a vehicle in another lane, or may not have time to react to a vehicle in your lane. You could crash into a vehicle ahead of you, or lose control of your vehicle. Give extra attention in curves and be ready to use the brakes if necessary. Select an appropriate speed while driving in curves.

ACC may operate differently in a sharp curve. It may reduce the vehicle speed if the curve is too sharp.

If equipped, the curve speed control indicator light b may illuminate green when ACC detects a sharp curve in the road ahead and is actively controlling the vehicle speed.

ACC may automatically decrease the vehicle speed while entering the curve. ACC may accelerate when exiting the curve, but it will not exceed the set speed.

When following a vehicle and entering a curve, ACC may not detect a vehicle ahead and accelerate to the set speed. When this happens, the vehicle ahead indicator light will not be displayed.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

ACC may detect a vehicle that is not in your lane and apply the brakes.

ACC may occasionally provide an alert and/or braking that is considered unnecessary. It could respond to vehicles in different lanes, signs,

guardrails, and other stationary objects when entering or exiting a curve. This is normal operation. The vehicle does not need service.

## Other Vehicle Lane Changes

ACC will not detect a vehicle ahead until it is completely in the lane. You must be prepared to apply the brakes if necessary.

<!-- image -->

## Objects Not Directly in Front of Your Vehicle

The detection of objects in front of your vehicle may not be possible if:

- · The vehicle ahead is shifted, not centered, or is shifted to one side of the lane.
- · The vehicle or object ahead is not within your lane.

## Driving in Narrow Lanes

Vehicles in adjacent traffic lanes or roadside objects may be incorrectly detected when located along the roadway.

## Do Not Use ACC on Hills

Do not use ACC when driving on steep hills as ACC may not detect a vehicle ahead.

<!-- image -->

## Towing with ACC

ACC may be used when towing a trailer when trailer attached is within the GM-approved allowable size and weight limits. See Trailer Towing 3 315 .

When towing a trailer, if equipped, and using ACC, the ACC driving characteristics such as the following gap, acceleration rates, and the braking rates may be modified to provide a better towing experience.

ACC should not be used while towing a trailer with an aftermarket trailer brake controller. Aftermarket trailer brake controllers may not function properly with the ACC system.

When towing a trailer with ACC, it is important to properly set the trailer gain. See the section 'Integrated Trailer Brake Control System' in Towing Equipment 3 319 for more information about the trailer gain adjustment procedure.

Use Tow/Haul mode when driving down steep hills or mountain grades, or when hauling heavy loads. See Driver Mode Control 3 244 .

ACC maintains the set speed when driving uphill and downhill while towing a trailer. However, ACC may make a slight changes to the cruise speed while driving on moderate hills if the combined vehicle and trailer weight is close to the maximum Gross Combined Weight Rating (GCWR). See Trailer Towing 3 315 . This is normal ACC operation and is necessary to maintain the set speed.

ACC may disengage if it detects that the brake temperature exceeds the normal range.

## Disengaging ACC

There are three ways to disengage ACC:

- · Lightly apply the brake pedal.
- · Press * .
- · Press 5 .

## Erasing Speed Memory

The cruise control set speed is erased from memory if 5 is pressed and when the vehicle is turned off.

## Weather Conditions Affecting ACC

System operation may be limited under snow, heavy rain, or road spray conditions.

## Accessory Installations and Vehicle Modifications

Do not install or place any object around the front camera windshield area that would obstruct the front camera view.

Do not install objects on top of the vehicle that overhang and obstruct the front camera, such as a canoe, kayak, or other items that can be transported on a roof rack system. See Roof Rack System 3 96 .

Do not modify the hood, headlamps, or fog lamps, as this may limit the camera's ability to detect an object.

## Cleaning the Sensing System

The camera sensor on the windshield behind the rearview mirror and the radar sensors on the front of the vehicle can become blocked by snow, ice, dirt, mud, or debris. These areas need to be cleaned for ACC to operate properly.

If ACC will not operate, regular cruise control may be available. See 'Switching Between ACC and Regular Cruise Control' previously in this section. Always consider driving conditions before using either cruise control system.

For cleaning instructions, see 'Washing the Vehicle' under Exterior Care 3 416 .

## Super Cruise

If equipped, Super Cruise can steer to maintain lane position under certain conditions on Super Cruise-enabled roads.

Super Cruise can also steer to perform a lane change under certain conditions on Super Cruise-enabled roads.

A lane change can be initiated by the driver using the turn signal lever.

If equipped with Automatic Lane Change, the Super Cruise system may initiate a lane change maneuver in the following scenarios:

- · When the current lane is ending ahead
- · To pass slower traffic
- · To return to the initial lane
- · To provide space for vehicles merging from an ending lane

See 'Super Cruise Lane Change' later in this section and Turn and Lane-Change Signals 3 142 .

<!-- image -->

## Warning

Super Cruise can only assist to maintain lane position, or steer to change lanes, when driving on compatible roads. You must supervise the driving task and monitor the road conditions. You may need to respond to traffic events by steering, braking, or accelerating. See Defensive Driving.

Super Cruise is:

- · Not a self-driving system

(Continued)

## Warning (Continued)

- · Not a crash avoidance or warning system
- · Not a substitute for proper supervision of the driving task

Super Cruise uses the following to detect the current lane position and lane markings ahead on Super Cruise-compatible roads under certain conditions:

- · Global Positioning System (GPS) sensing
- · Cameras
- · A high-precision map
- · GPS-enhancement data downloaded through OnStar

Super Cruise works with Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), which controls acceleration and braking while Super Cruise is enabled and operating. Carefully review and understand this 'Super Cruise' section and the 'Adaptive Cruise Control' section before using Super Cruise. See Adaptive Cruise Control (Advanced) 3 252 .

An active Connected Service plan that includes Super Cruise Services is required to use Super Cruise.

<!-- image -->

## Warning

Super Cruise does not perform all aspects of driving, nor does it do everything a driver can do. Super Cruise only steers to maintain vehicle position in the current lane or, under some circumstances, to change lanes. Super Cruise can only be used with Adaptive Cruise Control.

Super Cruise does:

- · Not steer to avoid stopped or slow-moving vehicles, cross-traffic, construction barriers or cones, motorcycles, children, pedestrians, animals, or other objects on the road.
- · Not prevent crashes or warn of possible crashes.
- · Not steer in response to vehicles or objects next to your vehicle, including vehicles attempting to enter your lane.

(Continued)

## Warning (Continued)

- · Not respond to traffic lights, stop signs, or other traffic control devices.
- · Not make turns.
- · Not respond to crossing traffic.
- · Not steer to merge onto or to exit highways.
- · Not function on surface streets.
- · Not steer to avoid, or steer through construction zones.
- · Not respond to oncoming traffic.
- · Not function in city driving conditions.

<!-- image -->

## Warning

Some state and local laws may require hands to be kept on the steering wheel at all times. Only remove your hands from the steering wheel if Super Cruise is engaged, it is safe to do so, and it is permitted by state and local laws.

<!-- image -->

## Warning

Failure to supervise the driving task and to respond appropriately, even while Super Cruise is operating, can cause a crash. Super Cruise may not respond as you would to all driving situations and may not maintain lane position under all conditions.

It is extremely important to pay attention to the operation of the vehicle, even while using Super Cruise. Do not use a handheld device while driving, even with Super Cruise engaged. To prevent serious injury or death:

- · Never remove your hands from the steering wheel when Super Cruise is not operating.
- · Always remain properly seated in the driver seat with your seat belt fastened.
- · Always make sure traffic conditions are safe before using Super Cruise.
- · Always keep the entire vehicle and the sensors clean. Sensors are on the front, sides, and rear of the vehicle.

## Warning

To prevent serious injury or death, only remove your hands from the steering wheel if the steering wheel light bar, ^ , and \ are green. Super Cruise may not begin steering immediately, even when Super Cruise is available and ] has been pressed.

<!-- image -->

To engage Super Cruise:

- 1. Press J to turn on ACC. Make sure the ACC indicator light \ displays white in the instrument cluster. See Adaptive Cruise Control (Advanced) 3 252 .
- When Super Cruise is available, the white Super Cruise indicator light ^ will display in the instrument cluster.
- 2. Press ] to engage Super Cruise. ACC will set the speed to the current vehicle speed or resume to the higher previously stored ACC set speed.

If equipped, when Auto Set Speed is enabled and a road speed limit sign is detected, ACC will change the set speed to the road speed limit (+/- the selected offset). For more information about Auto Set Speed customization, see Adaptive Cruise Control (Advanced) 3 252 .

<!-- image -->

## Warning

Always monitor the vehicle speed and make sure that you are following the speed limit, regardless of the Auto Set Speed status.

When engaged and not steering the vehicle, the steering wheel light bar flashes blue, and the Super Cruise indicator light ^ is lit blue. The driver is in control of steering and Super Cruise is not steering the vehicle.

When the vehicle is positioned in the center of the lane, the steering wheel light bar and the Super Cruise indicator light ^ are lit green, indicating that Super Cruise is steering the vehicle.

When Super Cruise controls the steering, traffic and other conditions and laws permit, and it is safe to do so, your hands can be taken off the steering wheel.

Always pay attention to the road and the operation of the vehicle. Always monitor and be attentive of surrounding traffic, including vehicles that may cross the road in front of your vehicle.

Super Cruise steering can be overridden with manual steering at any time. When Super Cruise is engaged, always be prepared to take immediate action - including steering, accelerating, and braking quickly, if necessary.

Super Cruise, when engaged, will enable the Forward Collision System to Alert and Brake.

## Steering Manually and Changing Lanes

The vehicle can always be manually steered, even with Super Cruise engaged; for example, when manually changing lanes.

When the steering wheel is moved manually, the steering wheel light bar flashes blue and the Super Cruise indicator light ^ turns blue on the instrument cluster to indicate that Super Cruise is not steering the vehicle.

When you are ready to allow Super Cruise to resume steering again, position the vehicle in the center of the lane, hold the steering wheel

until the steering wheel light bar turns green, and then release the steering wheel when it is safe to do so.

<!-- image -->

## Warning

To help prevent crashes before making a lane change:

- · Glance over your shoulder.
- · Always check mirrors.
- · Use the turn signals.

## Super Cruise Lane Change

Super Cruise can steer to perform a single lane change under certain conditions when requested by the driver activating a turn signal, or automatically when initiated by the Super Cruise system.

## On Demand Lane Changes

To request a lane change:

- 1. Verify the lane next to your vehicle is clear and conditions are safe to make a lane change.
- 2. Use the turn signal lever to activate the turn signal in the direction of the desired lane change.
- 3. Return the turn signal lever to the neutral position after the lane change. See Turn and Lane-Change Signals 3 142 .

To cancel a lane change, return the turn signal lever to the neutral position, move the lever in the opposite direction of the lane change, or steer manually at any time.

## Automatic Lane Changes

If equipped with automatic lane change, and if the automatic lane change setting is enabled, the Super Cruise system may initiate a single lane change under the following conditions:

- · To merge to the left or the right when current lane is ending ahead.
- · To use the left lane to pass a slower moving vehicle ahead and a subsequent lane change to right to return to your original lane.
- · To the left or the right when a slowermoving vehicle is detected in the adjacent ending lane to provide space for the merging vehicle.

To cancel a Super Cruise lane change, return the turn signal lever to the neutral position or move the turn signal lever.

Super Cruise steering can be overridden with manual steering at any time to cancel a Super Cruise lane change.

If the Super Cruise system detects that traffic is clear, Super Cruise will steer the vehicle to perform the lane change. A message appears on the Driver Information Center (DIC) during the lane change to provide more information on the status of the lane change.

Super Cruise Lane Change functionality is only available on Super Cruise-enabled divided roads.

Super Cruise Automatic Lane Change functionality is not available when a construction zone is detected.

Super Cruise Lane Change may be disabled when a trailer or other accessories (e.g., a bike rack, cargo tray, etc.) are detected.

Do not use Super Cruise Lane Change when towing a trailer.

The Super Cruise Lane Change feature can be customized to Off, Turn Signal Activated, or Automatic through vehicle settings. To view the available settings, from the infotainment home screen, touch Settings > Vehicle > Super Cruise Lane Change.

## Warning

Super Cruise Lane Change may not detect a vehicle in an adjacent lane. Always supervise the driving task and monitor traffic conditions when using the Super Cruise Lane Change feature. Only request a lane change when traffic conditions are safe for a lane change, and always be ready to manually steer the vehicle. See 'Steering Manually and Changing Lanes' listed previously in this section.

## Take Over Alert

<!-- image -->

## Warning

Super Cruise will not maintain the vehicle's speed while the steering wheel light bar is flashing red. If the steering wheel light bar flashes red, immediately resume manual steering to prevent serious injury or death. If you do not resume manual steering, the vehicle will begin to slow in the same lane and eventually come to a complete stop on the road.

Any time the steering wheel light bar flashes red, resume manual steering immediately.

<!-- image -->

To begin steering manually, hold the steering wheel firmly with both hands using the highlighted regions. The Super Cruise indicator light ^ will display red and a message will display in the DIC. In addition, beeps will sound, or the Safety Alert Seat will vibrate, if equipped. To view collision and detection settings from the infotainment home screen, touch Settings > Vehicle > Collision/Detection Systems. When you begin steering manually, Super Cruise will disengage.

The red flashing steering wheel light bar could occur under any of the following conditions:

- · The DAS does not detect that the driver's head and eyes are directed toward the road.
- · Lane markings are poor, or visibility is limited.
- · ACC has been canceled.
- · The road speed limit of the Super Cruisecompatible non-divided road is below 72 km/h (45 mph).
- · The vehicle is on a tight curve, or the lanes are too wide, or the vehicle enters a curve too fast.
- · The Super Cruise-compatible road ends.
- · A Super Cruise system fault occurs.
- · The vehicle is approaching an intersection controlled by a traffic light, stop sign, or other traffic control device.
- · Super Cruise is unable to complete the lane change maneuver.
- · The Super Cruise system detects a very cold outside air temperature.

## Attention to the Road

<!-- image -->

## Warning

Super Cruise is a driver assistance system and cannot accurately detect or predict all situations. Super Cruise is not a crash avoidance system. To prevent serious injury or death, you must supervise the driving task and monitor the road conditions. You may need to respond to traffic events by steering, braking, or accelerating. See Defensive Driving 3 209 . Super Cruise also cannot determine whether you are awake, asleep, impaired, or properly focused on safe driving. The vehicle could crash into other vehicles, drive out of the lane, or drive off the road. Complete attention is always required while driving, even while using Super Cruise. Be prepared to take over steering or apply the brakes at any time.

<!-- image -->

## Warning

To prevent serious injury or death, be alert and pay special attention when passing highway exits, entrances, and crossings with Super Cruise, and be ready to take control of the vehicle when necessary. Changes in lane markings around exits and entrances can momentarily cause Super Cruise to not detect the correct lane. If this occurs, Super Cruise may attempt steering inputs to bring the vehicle back into the correct lane and, in rare circumstances, could over-correct and cause the vehicle to momentarily cross into a lane next to your vehicle unless you manually steer to maintain your lane position.

The Driver Attention System (DAS) on the steering column continually monitors driver head and eye position to estimate driver attention to the road. The camera does not record or share pictures, audio, or video.

Sunglasses, hats, or other types of clothing that change the shape of the head may interfere with camera performance. To improve camera performance, raise or lower the steering wheel, or change the seat position.

## Pay close attention to the road ahead to avoid these three increasing alerts:

| · If the steering wheel light bar flashes green, the system has detected that your head and eyes may not be directed toward the road. · The flashing will stop when the system detects that your head and eyes appear to be directed toward the road.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | First Alert   |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| · If the steering wheel light bar flashes green for too long, Super Cruise will alert the driver to take control of steering immediately by flashing the light bar red. In addition, beeps will sound or the Safety Alert Seat will vibrate, if equipped. To view the available alert settings on the infotainment home screen, touch Settings > Vehicle > Collision/Detection Systems > Alert Type. · Take over steering, then Super Cruise may disengage or the steering wheel light bar flashes blue to indicate driver override. Do not take your hands off of the steering wheel until the steering wheel light bar illuminates green. · To re-engage Super Cruise after disengagement, press  ] . See 'Using Super Cruise' previously in this section. | Second Alert  |
| · If the steering wheel light bar flashes red for too long, a voice command will tell you to take control of the vehicle. · Take control of the steering immediately; ACC and Super Cruise will disengage. · A DIC message will indicate that Super Cruise is locked out. Super Cruise cannot be re-engaged until the next ignition cycle. · Continued failure to take over steering will cause the vehicle to brake to a stop and OnStar will be called. The brake lamps and hazard warning flashers will come on. · Take control of the vehicle and continue driving.                                                                                                                                                                                      | Third Alert   |

## Stationary or Very Slow-Moving Objects; Cross-Traffic

<!-- image -->

## Warning

Super Cruise is not a crash avoidance system. Super Cruise does not steer to prevent a crash with stopped or slow moving vehicles, or with vehicles crossing the road such as those that are traveling through intersections. You must supervise the driving task and may need to steer and brake to prevent a crash, especially in stop-and-go traffic or when a vehicle suddenly enters your lane. Always pay attention when using Super Cruise. Failure to do so could result in a crash involving serious injury or death.

## Curves in the Road

<!-- image -->

## Warning

The vehicle could drift out of your lane of travel. To prevent crashes, always be ready to manually steer.

(Continued)

## Warning (Continued)

Super Cruise may not detect your lane on curves in the road. Super Cruise may not detect the markings that show your lane. You may not have time to react to a vehicle in the lane next to your vehicle while on curves in the road.

Super Cruise may hand control back to the driver more often driving around a sharp curve while towing a trailer.

Super Cruise may operate differently in sharp curves. It may drift out of your lane of travel if the curve is too sharp.

<!-- image -->

When entering a curve, Super Cruise may not detect the lane markings and may not adjust the steering enough to stay in your lane of travel. When this happens, you will need to steer the vehicle.

Super Cruise may detect other lane markings that are not in your lane and may or may not steer appropriately to maintain your lane.

<!-- image -->

Super Cruise may occasionally provide an alert and/or steering that is considered unnecessary. It could respond to lane markings in different lanes, signs, guardrails, and other stationary objects when entering or exiting a curve. This is normal operation. The vehicle does not need service.

## Other Vehicles Entering Your Lane

<!-- image -->

Super Cruise may not detect a vehicle that enters your lane, or may not brake fast enough to avoid a crash. You must manually brake and steer the vehicle.

## Intersections; Vehicles Crossing the Road Ahead

Super Cruise will not brake the vehicle when approaching an intersection that is controlled by a traffic light or stop sign. Super Cruise will not detect vehicles crossing the road ahead, including at intersections, and will not automatically steer or brake to prevent a collision. You must manually brake and steer the vehicle.

## Towing a Trailer

Super Cruise may be used when towing a trailer when the connected trailer is within the size and weight limits designated in the section 'Trailer Towing.' See Trailer Towing 3 315 .

When Super Cruise is used with vehicles that are equipped with an aftermarket trailer brake controller, Super Cruise may not disengage when the manual trailer brake is applied. Do not use Super Cruise Lane Change when towing a trailer.

For additional information on towing a trailer, see Trailer Towing 3 315 .

## Super Cruise on Hills

Do not use Super Cruise while driving on steep hills.

## Super Cruise on Non-Divided Roads

Super Cruise may be available on non-divided roads that are mapped, outside of urbanized areas, and have a road speed limit above 72 km/h (45 mph).

The Super Cruise system is a highly sophisticated system and should only be serviced by technicians with the proper training, tools, and safety instructions, which your dealer has. Without proper training and tools the vehicle may become damaged.

The camera on the steering column has a lens cover that may become dirty over time and affect camera performance. Clean the lens cover with a soft cloth sprayed with glass cleaner. Wipe the lens gently, then dry it. Never use abrasive cloths/cleaners or corrosive chemicals of any kind on the lens cover.

Super Cruise uses the front radar, front camera, and 360-degree cameras for its operation. Clean surfaces are required for Super Cruise operation. See Adaptive Cruise Control (Advanced) 3 252 , 'Surround Vision Camera' under Assistance Systems for Parking or Backing 3 279 , and Lane Keep Assist (LKA) 3 304 for care information.

## Troubleshooting

The Transparent Trailer calibration may take longer than expected or not calibrate if:

- · The vehicle is not driven straight during calibration. Steering should be maintained as straight as possible, excessive steering during calibration may extend calibration time.
- · The vehicle is driven too fast during calibration. Speed should be maintained below 50 km/h (31 mph).
- · The calibration is attempted in low light. Calibration should be attempted when there is enough light.
- · The road surface is not ideal for calibration. Calibration should be attempted on an alternate road surface.
- · The calibration is attempted during adverse weather conditions. Calibration during conditions such as snow or heavy rain should be avoided.
- · The accessory trailer cameras are swapped at the hitch connector. Ensure that the camera mounted to the rear of the trailer is connected to the rear trailer camera input.

- · The accessory trailer camera is mounted, angled or rotated outside of the defined mounting location (see camera installation instructions).

Distortion may be observed in the calibrated Transparent Trailer View if:

- · The accessory trailer camera is mounted, angled or rotated outside of the defined mounting location (see camera installation instructions).

The Transparent Trailer icon may appear grayed out if:

- · The vehicle is in R (Reverse).
- · A compatible trailer profile is not configured or a non-compatible trailer profile is selected.
- · The trailer is not connected.
- · The accessory rear trailer camera is not connected or connected to the incorrect input.

The preview may not be provided or the wrong preview may be provided if:

- · The accessory cameras are not recognized. Ensure that the accessory camera(s) are connected and power cycle the vehicle.

- · The accessory trailer cameras are swapped at the hitch connector. Ensure that the accessory camera(s) are connected to the correct input.
- · The accessory trailer camera(s) are not installed according to the installation instructions.

A view may switch automatically if:

- · The vehicle is shifted to another gear.

## Park Assist

The vehicle may be equipped with Rear Park Assist (RPA) or Front and Rear Park Assist (FRPA). Under certain conditions, the Park Assist system can assist the driver during backing and parking maneuvers when the

vehicle is driven at no more than 9 km/h (6 mph). An illuminated indicator in the Park Assist button indicates the system is ready.

Sensors located in the bumpers measure the distance between the vehicle and objects using sonar technology. These sensors are designed to detect certain objects up to 1.8 m (6 ft) behind and 1.3 m (4 ft) in front of your vehicle that are taller than 25 cm (10 in).

Different environmental conditions may affect whether and how far the Park Assist system can detect objects. Keep the sensors clean of mud, dirt, snow, ice, and slush; and clean sensors after a car wash in freezing temperatures. Sensors that are not clean may not detect objects or may cause the system to alert when not required.

<!-- image -->

## Warning

The Park Assist System is no substitute for careful and attentive driving. The Park Assist system does not detect children, pedestrians, bicyclists, animals, or objects located below the bumper or that are too close or too far from the vehicle. It is not

(Continued)

## Warning (Continued)

available at speeds greater than 9 km/h (6 mph). To prevent injury, death, or vehicle damage, even with Park Assist, always check the area around the vehicle and check all mirrors before moving forward or backing.

## How the System Works

The vehicle may have a Park Assist amphitheatre-like display on the cluster with bars that represent the estimated location of a detected object and the vehicle's distance from the object. As a detected object becomes closer, more bars light up and change color from yellow to amber to red. Vehicles equipped with RPA will show the amphitheater at the rear of the vehicle, and if equipped, FRPA will show the amphitheater at the front and rear.

The system warns the driver with beeps against potentially hazardous obstacles in the path of the vehicle. When an object in the driving path is first detected in the rear, one beep will be heard from the rear, or the driver's seat will pulse two times if equipped with Safety Alert Seat. When an object is very close, five beeps will sound from the front or rear, depending

on the object's location, or the driver's seat will pulse five times. Beeps for front are higher pitched than the rear. The beeps may be muted by pressing the on screen mute button.

<!-- image -->

## Turning the System On and Off

The Park Assist System can be turned on or off using the infotainment system. To view available settings for this feature, touch the Settings icon on the infotainment home page. Select 'Vehicle' to display the list of available options and select 'Collision/ Detection Systems'.

Turning the Park Assist System on or off also turns the Backing Warning and Reverse Automatic Braking (RAB) on or off at the same time.

When the system is off, PARK ASSIST OFF is shown on the display. This message disappears after a short period of time.

If the vehicle has a trailer hitch attached, select ON - ATTACHED using the infotainment system menus to allow Park Assist to function properly. Park Assist is able to compensate for a trailer hitch up to 0.3 m (1 ft) in length and width. Park Assist may not function properly with larger trailer hitches and provide inaccurate information of objects in the rear

Turn off Park Assist when towing a trailer to prevent unwanted beeps and when a bike rack is attached to ensure proper operation.

## When the System Does Not Seem to Work Properly

The following messages may be shown on the display:

## SERVICE PARK ASSIST

If this message displays, check the following conditions:

- · The sensors may not be clean. Keep the vehicle's front and rear bumpers free of mud, dirt, snow, ice, and slush. For cleaning instructions, see Exterior Care 3 416 .

- · The Park Assist sensors may be covered by frost or ice. Frost or ice can form around and behind the sensors and may not always be seen; this can occur after washing the vehicle in cold weather. The message may not clear until the frost or ice has melted.

If this message displays and the above conditions do not exist, take the vehicle to your dealer for repair.

## PARK ASSIST OFF

If the Park Assist System does not activate due to a temporary condition, this message is shown on the display. This can occur under the following conditions:

- · An object is currently blocking the rear sensors (for example, bike rack, tailgate, trailer hitch, etc.) Once the object is removed, Park Assist will return to normal operation.
- · The driver has disabled the system.
- · The bumper is damaged. Take the vehicle to your dealer for repairs.
- · Other conditions, such as vibrations from a jackhammer or the compression of air brakes on a very large truck, are affecting system performance.

## Automatic Parking Assist (APA)

If equipped, under certain conditions Enhanced Automatic Parking Assist (APA) can use sensors based on sonar technology along the vehicle's front, rear and sides to detect a parking spot and automatically park the vehicle. The vehicle will automatically maneuver into a detected spot moving at or near idle speed. It does this by automatically steering, braking, accelerating, and gear shifting. The driver must always be prepared to apply braking if necessary.  A display and beeps help to guide the parking maneuvers.

<!-- image -->

## Warning

APA may not always detect objects in the parking space, objects that are not rigid (e.g. shrubs and chain-link fences), objects below the bumper, objects high off the ground (e.g. flatbed trucks), hanging objects, objects below ground level (e.g. large potholes), or moving objects (e.g. pedestrians, cyclists, vehicles). Always verify that the parking space is appropriate for parking a vehicle. APA may not respond

(Continued)

## Warning (Continued)

to changes in the parking space, such as movement of an adjacent vehicle, or a person or object entering the parking space. APA does not detect or avoid traffic that is behind or alongside of the vehicle. Always be prepared to stop the vehicle during the parking maneuver.

## How to Activate Automatic Parking

To activate APA, press O on the Home Page of the infotainment display for the system to begin searching for a parking space while driving forward at no greater than 30 km/h (18 mph). By default, APA searches for parallel parking spaces to the right of the vehicle up to the sensors' range of 1.5 m (5 ft). To search for a parking space to the left, turn on the left turn signal or, if available, change the side selection in the infotainment display. To switch the parking mode between parallel and perpendicular press and hold O while searching for a valid parking spot or, if available, change the parking mode in the infotainment display.

APA cannot park in all empty parking spots. The parking spot must:

- · Have an adjacent vehicle, wall, or pillar for the system to align to.
- · Be sufficiently large to fit the vehicle comfortably.

<!-- image -->

After completely passing an eligible parking spot, a beep sounds and a red stop symbol is displayed in the driver information center. Generally, APA selects the nearest empty parking spot behind the vehicle, but under some conditions may select a space that is further back. Slow down and bring the vehicle to a complete stop to begin.

Follow the displayed instructions.  When instructed to drive in reverse, shift to R (Reverse) while holding the brakes. The steering wheel will vibrate briefly as

a reminder to remove hands from the steering wheel. Release the brakes slowly when the vibration stops to begin automatic parking. As the vehicle automatically steers, brakes, accelerates, and shifts gears into the parking spot, check surroundings. Be prepared to stop to avoid vehicles, pedestrians, or objects.

A progress arrow displays the status of the parking maneuver. Once automatic parking is finished and the vehicle has come to a full stop, FINAL POSITION - PRESS BRAKES message will be displayed. Press and hold the brakes, and APA will beep and display a PARKING COMPLETE message. Shift the vehicle to P (Park) and apply the parking brake.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## How to Activate Automatic Parallel Spot Unparking Assist

To activate parallel spot unparking assist, press the soft-touch button or hard switch O after turning on the vehicle while leaving it in P (Park) and the parking brake is off.  If the system is able to determine a path out of the parking spot, a screen will be displayed for unparking options.  Similar to automatic parking, follow the displayed instructions and check surroundings as the vehicle unparks.

Once automatic unparking is finished and the vehicle has come to a full stop, FINAL POSITION PRESS BRAKES message will be displayed. Press and hold the brakes, and APA will beep and display a TAKE CONTROL message. The vehicle is now positioned such that the path to exit the parking spot is free of obstructions. Shift into D (Drive) to start driving away.

<!-- image -->

## How to Cancel Automatic Parking or Automatic Unparking

To cancel automatic parking or automatic unparking at any time, press O or "X" on the infotainment display and be prepared to resume control of the vehicle. APA holds the vehicle until the parking brake or brake is applied, or the vehicle is shifted into P (Park). To start driving away, press the brakes and shift into D (Drive).

Certain vehicle conditions and driver interferences may also cancel automatic parking:

- · The maximum allowed speed is exceeded.
- · The driver manually steers the vehicle.
- · There is a failure with the APA system.
- · The parking brake is applied or vehicle is shifted into Park (P).
- · Electronic stability control or antilock brakes are activated.
- · Driver unbuckles seat belt and opens door.

## System Limitations

Automatic Parking Assist has certain limitations.  The system cannot:

- · Maneuver the vehicle at speeds exceeding 5 km/h (3 mph).
- · Detect whether a parking space is legal or restricted.
- · Maneuver the vehicle on a steep hill.
- · Detect pavement markings or lines
- · Park exactly centered in a very large spot.
- · Park the vehicle closely lined up with the vehicle next to it, particularly if the spot is approached at an angle or if the parking space is angled.
- · Always detect short curbs.
- · Function the vehicle is raised or lowered by air suspension (if equipped).
- · Operate while towing any trailer.
- · Detect or automatically react to approaching traffic when exiting a parallel spot

## When the System Does Not Seem to Work Properly

If the vehicle does not reverse into the expected parking space, the system could be maneuvering the vehicle into a previously detected space.

## Reverse Automatic Braking (RAB)

## Backing Warning and Reverse Automatic Braking (RAB)

If equipped, vehicles with Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) have the Backing Warning System and Reverse Automatic Braking (RAB) system. When in R (Reverse), Backing Warning alerts of rear objects at vehicle speeds greater than 8 km/h (5 mph), and RAB may automatically brake hard at speeds between 1-32 km/h (0.5-20 mph).

The Backing Warning System will beep once from the rear when an object is first detected, or pulse twice on both sides of the Safety Alert Seat. When the system detects a potential crash, beeps will be heard from the rear, or five pulses will be felt on both sides of the Safety Alert Seat. There may also be a brief, sharp application of the brakes.

<!-- image -->

## Warning

The Backing Warning System only operates at speeds greater than 8 km/h (5 mph). It does not detect children, pedestrians,

(Continued)

## Warning (Continued)

bicyclists, animals, or objects below the bumper or that are too close or too far from the vehicle. In some situations, such as at higher backing speeds, there may not be enough time for the short, sharp application of the vehicle brake system to occur. To prevent injury, death, or vehicle damage, even with the Backing Warning System, always check the area around the vehicle and check all mirrors before backing.

When the vehicle is in R (Reverse), if the system detects the vehicle is backing too fast to avoid a crash with a detected object behind your vehicle in your path, it may automatically brake hard to a stop to help avoid or reduce the harm caused by a backing crash.

<!-- image -->

## Warning

RAB may not avoid many types of backing crashes. Do not wait for the automatic braking to apply. This system is not

(Continued)

## Warning (Continued)

designed to replace driver braking and only works in R (Reverse) when an object is detected directly behind the vehicle. It may not brake or stop in time to avoid a crash. It will not brake for objects when the vehicle is moving at very low speeds. It does not detect children, pedestrians, bicyclists, animals, or objects below the bumper or that are too close or too far from the vehicle. To prevent injury, death, or vehicle damage, even with RAB, always check the area around the vehicle before and while backing.

Pressing the brake pedal after the vehicle comes to a stop will release RAB. If the brake pedal is not pressed soon after the stop, the Electric Parking Brake (EPB) may be set. When it is safe, press the accelerator pedal firmly at any time to override RAB.

<!-- image -->

## Warning

There may be instances where unexpected or undesired automatic braking occurs. If this happens, either press the brake pedal or firmly press the accelerator pedal to release the brakes from the RAB system. Before releasing the brakes, check the RVC and check the area around the vehicle to make sure it is safe to proceed.

Unexpected braking events are possible with a static installed accessory, such as a bike rack or hitch-mounted cargo carrier.

## Rear Pedestrian Alert

If equipped, and under certain conditions, this feature can provide alerts for a pedestrian within the system's range directly behind the vehicle. This feature only works in R (Reverse) below 12 km/h (8 mph), and detects pedestrians up to 8 m (26 ft) away during daytime driving. During nighttime driving, feature performance is very limited.

<!-- image -->

## Rear Pedestrian Alert Indicator

When a pedestrian is detected within the system's range directly behind the vehicle, this symbol flashes amber on the infotainment display, along with five beeps from the rear, or if equipped, two pulses from both sides of the driver seat. When a pedestrian is detected close to the vehicle, the symbol flashes red on the infotainment display, along with ten beeps from the rear, or if equipped, seven pulses from both sides of the driver seat.

<!-- image -->

## Warning

Rear Pedestrian Alert does not automatically brake the vehicle. It also does not provide an alert unless it detects a pedestrian, and it may not detect all pedestrians if:

(Continued)

## Warning (Continued)

- · The pedestrian is not directly behind the vehicle, fully visible to the Rear Vision Camera (RVC), or standing upright.
- · The pedestrian is a child.
- · The pedestrian is part of a group.

## Rear Cross Traffic Alert (RCTA) System

If equipped, Rear Cross Traffic Alert (RCTA) displays a red warning triangle with a left or right pointing arrow on the infotainment display to warn of traffic coming from the left or right. This system detects objects coming from up to 20 m (65 ft) from the left or right side of the vehicle. When an object is detected, either three beeps sound from the left or right or three Safety Alert Seat pulses occur on the left or right side, depending on the direction of the detected vehicle.

## Driving With a Trailer

Use caution while backing up when towing a trailer. The RCTA feature is automatically disabled when a trailer is attached to the vehicle.

## Turning the Features On or Off

To view available settings for this feature, touch the Settings icon on the infotainment home page. Select 'Vehicle' to display the list of available options and select 'Collision/ Detection Systems'.

## Assistance Systems for Driving

If equipped, when driving the vehicle in a forward gear, Forward Collision Alert (FCA), Front Pedestrian Braking (FPB), Lane Keep Assist (LKA), Side Blind Zone Alert (SBZA), Night Vision System, Lane Change Alert (LCA), and/or Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB) can help to avoid a crash or reduce crash damage.

## Forward Collision Alert (FCA) System

The FCA system may help to avoid or reduce the harm caused by front-end crashes. When approaching a vehicle ahead too quickly, FCA provides a red flashing alert on the windshield and rapidly beeps or pulses the driver seat. FCA also lights an amber visual alert if following another vehicle much too closely.

FCA detects vehicles within a distance of approximately 60 m (197 ft) and operates at speeds above 8 km/h (5 mph). If the vehicle has Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), it can detect vehicles to distances of approximately 110 m (360 ft) and operates at all speeds. See Adaptive Cruise Control (Advanced) 3 252 .

<!-- image -->

## Warning

FCA is a warning system and does not apply the brakes. When approaching a slowermoving or stopped vehicle ahead too rapidly, or when following a vehicle too closely, FCA may not provide a warning with enough time to help avoid a crash. It also may not provide any warning at all. FCA does not warn of pedestrians, animals, signs, guardrails, bridges, construction barrels, or other objects. Be ready to take action and apply the brakes. See Defensive Driving 3 209 .

FCA can be disabled through vehicle settings. To view available settings from the infotainment home screen, touch Settings > Vehicle > Collision/Detection Systems.

## Detecting the Vehicle Ahead

<!-- image -->

FCA warnings will not occur unless the FCA system detects a vehicle ahead. When a vehicle is detected, the vehicle ahead indicator will display green. Vehicles may not be detected on curves, highway exit ramps, or hills, due to poor visibility; or if a vehicle ahead is partially blocked by pedestrians or other objects. FCA will not detect another vehicle ahead until it is completely in the driving lane.

<!-- image -->

## Warning

FCA does not provide a warning to help avoid a crash, unless it detects a vehicle. FCA may not detect a vehicle ahead if the FCA sensor is blocked by dirt, snow, or ice, or if the windshield is damaged. It may also not detect a vehicle on winding or hilly roads, or in conditions that can limit

(Continued)

## Warning (Continued)

visibility such as fog, rain, or snow, or if the headlamps or windshield are not cleaned or in proper condition. Keep the windshield, headlamps, and FCA sensors clean and in good repair.

## Collision Alert

With Head-Up Display

<!-- image -->

Without Head-Up Display

<!-- image -->

When your vehicle approaches another detected vehicle too rapidly, the red FCA display will flash on the windshield. Also, eight rapid high-pitched beeps will sound from the front, or both sides of the Safety Alert Seat will pulse five times. When this Collision Alert occurs, the brake system may prepare for driver braking to occur more rapidly which can cause a brief, mild deceleration. Continue to apply the brake pedal as needed.

## Tailgating Alert

<!-- image -->

The vehicle ahead indicator will display amber when you are following a vehicle ahead much too closely.

## Selecting the Alert Timing

<!-- image -->

The Collision Alert control is on the steering wheel. Press [ to set the FCA timing to Far, Medium, or Near. The first button press shows the current setting on the DIC. Additional button presses will change this setting. The chosen setting will remain until it is changed and will affect the timing of both the Collision Alert and the Tailgating Alert features. The timing of both alerts will vary based on vehicle speed. The faster the vehicle speed, the farther away the alert will occur. Consider traffic and weather conditions when selecting the alert timing. The range of selectable alert timings may not be appropriate for all drivers and driving conditions.

If your vehicle is equipped with Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), changing the FCA timing setting automatically changes the following gap setting (Far, Medium, or Near).

## Unnecessary Alerts

FCA may provide unnecessary alerts for turning vehicles, vehicles in other lanes, objects that are not vehicles, or shadows. These alerts are normal operation and the vehicle does not need service.

## Cleaning the System

If the FCA system does not seem to operate properly, this may correct the issue:

- · Clean the entire front of the vehicle.
- · Clean the outside of the windshield in front of the rearview mirror.
- · Clean the headlamps.

## Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB)

If equipped, the AEB system may help avoid or reduce the harm caused by front-end crashes. AEB also includes Intelligent Brake Assist (IBA). When the system detects a vehicle ahead in your path that is traveling in the same direction that you may be about to crash into, it can provide a boost to braking or automatically brake the vehicle. This can help avoid or lessen the severity of crashes when

driving in a forward gear. Depending on the situation, the vehicle may automatically brake moderately or hard. Always wear a seat belt and ensure that all passengers are properly restrained. This Automatic Emergency Braking can only occur if a vehicle is detected. This is shown by the FCA vehicle ahead indicator being lit. See Forward Collision Alert (FCA) System 3 292 .

The system works when driving in a forward gear above 4 km/h (2 mph). It can detect vehicles up to approximately 60 m (197 ft).

<!-- image -->

## Warning

AEB is an emergency crash preparation feature and is not designed to avoid crashes. Do not rely on AEB to brake the vehicle. AEB will not brake outside of its operating speed range and only responds to detected vehicles.

AEB may not:

- · Detect a vehicle ahead on winding or hilly roads.

(Continued)

## Warning (Continued)

- · Detect all vehicles, especially vehicles with a trailer, tractors, muddy vehicles, etc.
- · Detect a vehicle ahead if it is partially blocked by pedestrians or other objects.
- · Detect a vehicle when weather limits visibility, such as in fog, rain, or snow.

Complete attention is always required while driving, and you should be ready to take action and apply the brakes and/or steer the vehicle to avoid crashes.

AEB may slow the vehicle to a complete stop to try to avoid a potential crash. If this happens, AEB may engage the Electric Parking Brake (EPB) to hold the vehicle at a stop. Release the EPB or firmly press the accelerator pedal.

<!-- image -->

## Warning

AEB may automatically brake the vehicle suddenly in situations where it is unexpected and undesired. It could respond (Continued)

## Warning (Continued)

to a turning vehicle ahead, guardrails, signs, and other non-moving objects. To override AEB, firmly press the accelerator pedal, if it is safe to do so.

## Intelligent Brake Assist (IBA)

IBA may activate when the brake pedal is applied quickly by providing a boost to braking based on the speed of approach and distance to a vehicle ahead.

Minor brake pedal pulsations or pedal movement during this time is normal and the brake pedal should continue to be applied as needed. IBA will automatically disengage only when the brake pedal is released.

<!-- image -->

{

## Warning

IBA may increase vehicle braking in situations when it may not be necessary. You could block the flow of traffic. If this occurs, take your foot off the brake pedal and then apply the brakes as needed.

AEB and IBA can be disabled through vehicle personalization. To view available settings for this feature, touch the Settings icon on the infotainment home page. Select 'Vehicle' to display the list of available options and select 'Collision/Detection Systems'.

A system unavailable message may display if:

- · Heavy rain or snow is interfering with object detection.
- · The front of the vehicle or windshield is not clean.
- · There is a problem with the StabiliTrak/ Electronic Stability Control (ESC) system.

The AEB system does not need service.

## Front Pedestrian Braking (FPB) System

If equipped, the FPB system may help avoid or reduce the harm caused by front-end crashes with nearby pedestrians when driving in a forward gear. FPB displays an amber indicator, ~ , when a nearby pedestrian is detected ahead. When approaching a detected pedestrian too quickly, FPB provides a red flashing alert on the windshield and rapidly beeps or pulses the driver seat. FPB can provide

a boost to braking or automatically brake the vehicle. This system includes Intelligent Brake Assist (IBA), and the Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB) system may also respond to pedestrians. Always wear a seat belt and ensure that all passengers are properly restrained. See Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB) 3 294 .

The FPB system can detect and alert to pedestrians in a forward gear at speeds between 8 km/h (5 mph) and 80 km/h (50 mph). During daytime driving, the system detects pedestrians up to a distance of approximately 40 m (131 ft). During nighttime driving, system performance is very limited. If equipped, during nighttime driving, the Night Vision system can detect and alert to pedestrians when the vehicle is in a forward gear. See Night Vision System 3 298 .

<!-- image -->

## Warning

FPB does not provide an alert or automatically brake the vehicle, unless it detects a pedestrian. FPB may not detect pedestrians, including children:

(Continued)

## Warning (Continued)

- · When the pedestrian is not directly ahead, fully visible, or standing upright, or when part of a group.
- · If the FPB sensor is blocked by dirt, snow, or ice.
- · Due to poor visibility, including nighttime conditions, fog, rain, or snow.
- · If the headlamps or windshield are not cleaned or in proper condition.

Be ready to take action and apply the brakes. For more information, see Defensive Driving 3 209 . Keep the windshield, headlamps, and FPB sensor clean and in good repair.

FPB can be set to Off, Alert, or Alert and Brake through vehicle settings. To view available settings from the infotainment screen, touch Settings > Vehicle > Collision/ Detection Systems.

## Detecting the Pedestrian Ahead

<!-- image -->

FPB alerts and automatic braking will not occur unless the FPB system detects a pedestrian. When a pedestrian that may enter the vehicle's forward path is detected, the pedestrian ahead indicator will display amber.

## Front Pedestrian Alert

<!-- image -->

## With Head-Up Display

<!-- image -->

## Without Head-Up Display

When the vehicle approaches a pedestrian ahead too rapidly, the red FPB alert display will flash on the windshield. Eight rapid highpitched beeps will sound from the front, or both sides of the Safety Alert Seat will pulse five times. When this Pedestrian Alert occurs, the brake system may prepare for driver braking to occur more rapidly which can cause a brief, mild deceleration. Continue to apply the brake pedal as needed. Cruise control may be disengaged when the Front Pedestrian Alert occurs.

## Automatic Braking

If FPB detects it is about to crash into a pedestrian directly ahead, and the brakes have not been applied, FPB may automatically brake moderately or brake hard. This can help to avoid some very low speed pedestrian crashes or reduce pedestrian injury. FPB can automatically brake to detected pedestrians

between 8 km/h (5 mph) and 80 km/h (50 mph). Automatic braking levels may be reduced under certain conditions, such as higher speeds.

FPB may slow the vehicle to a complete stop to try to avoid a potential collision with a pedestrian. If this happens, AEB may engage the Electric Parking Brake (EPB) to hold the vehicle at a stop. Firmly press the accelerator pedal to release AEB and the EPB. If equipped, Pedestrians detected by the Night Vision system will not cause automatic braking to occur.

<!-- image -->

## Warning

FPB may alert or automatically brake the vehicle suddenly in situations where it is unexpected and undesired. It could falsely alert or brake for objects similar in shape or size to pedestrians, including shadows. This is normal operation and the vehicle does not need service. To override Automatic Braking, firmly press the accelerator pedal, if it is safe to do so.

Automatic Braking can be disabled through vehicle settings.To view available settings from the infotainment screen, touch Settings > Vehicle > Collision/Detection Systems > Front Pedestrian Detection.

## Cleaning the System

If FPB does not seem to operate properly, cleaning the outside of the windshield in front of the rearview mirror may correct the issue.

## Night Vision System

If equipped, this system can help the driver see and alert the driver to pedestrians or large animals ahead of the vehicle beyond the area lit by the headlamps. A thermal heat image of the view ahead is displayed when it is dark enough outside. If a pedestrian or large animal is detected more than 25 m (82 ft) away, a yellow box appears around the pedestrian or large animal. With the vehicle moving, when the system detects a pedestrian or large animal may approach or cross the vehicle's path, an amber pedestrian or animal icon displays and an amber box appears around the identified object. When the system detects that the

vehicle is approaching a pedestrian or large animal ahead too quickly, the yellow or amber box changes to red.

<!-- image -->

With the Pedestrian Braking system turned on, Night Vision provides a red Head-Up Display (HUD) alert when the system detects that the vehicle is approaching a pedestrian ahead too quickly. In addition, an alert beeps or the Safety Alert Seat pulses, if equipped. See Front Pedestrian Braking (FPB) System 3 296 .

<!-- image -->

## Warning

The system does not detect all objects or the vehicle distance from objects. The system may not provide a warning with enough time to help avoid a crash.

<!-- image -->

- 1. Low-Beam Headlamps
- 2. High-Beam Headlamps
- 3. Night Vision System

By selecting a view on the instrument cluster, the Night Vision image can be displayed. See Instrument Cluster 3 108 . The Night Vision system can operate only if:

- · The vehicle is in P (Park) or a forward gear.
- · The ignition is on.
- · It is dark enough outside.
- · The headlamps are on, except when parked.

Turn the image off by selecting another view on the instrument cluster. The night vision image brightness and contrast can be adjusted individually using the front center console display.

Warm objects, such as pedestrians, animals, and other moving vehicles, should appear whiter on the Night Vision display. Cold objects, such as the sky, signs, and parked vehicles, should appear darker. Night Vision only shows objects that are warmer or colder than the surroundings. It does not detect brake lamps, turn signals, emergency flashers, traffic lights, or sign information.

Use this system as an aid by occasionally glancing at the image. Do not stare at the image or use the image under well-lit conditions.

<!-- image -->

## Warning

Do not stare at the image while driving as this might cause important objects ahead not to be seen. You could crash, and you or others could be injured.

When a pedestrian or large animal is detected, a yellow box will be drawn around it. With the vehicle moving when the pedestrian or animal

may be in the vehicle path, an amber box displays around the pedestrian or animal on the Night Vision display and an amber pedestrian icon, ~ , or animal icon, ! , displays on the instrument cluster. This pedestrian icon is also shown on the Head-Up Display (HUD). When the system detects the vehicle is approaching a pedestrian or large animal too quickly, the amber pedestrian icon or animal icon and amber box turns red, and a red flashing icon, ~ or ! , displays on the HUD with rapid beeping or pulsing of the Safety Alert Seat, if equipped.

System pedestrian icons, beeps, and (if equipped) Safety Alert Seat pulses can be set to Off through vehicle settings by turning off the Front Pedestrian Braking system. To view available settings from the infotainment screen, touch Settings > Vehicle > Collision/Detection Systems > Front Pedestrian Detection.

<!-- image -->

## Warning

The Night Vision system does not automatically apply the brakes. It does not provide alerts unless it detects a pedestrian or large animal. The system may not detect pedestrians, including children, or animals:

- · If they are not directly ahead in the sensor coverage area, fully visible, standing upright, or part of a group.
- · If they are less than 25 m (82 ft) away.
- · If the person or animal is moving too quickly through the field of view, such as a bicyclist.
- · If headlamps are off, except when parked.
- · If the pedestrian is wearing insulated clothing.
- · If the outside temperature is above 30° c (86° f).
- · Due to poor visibility, including in heavy fog, rain, or snow.

(Continued)

## Warning (Continued)

- · If the sensor is blocked by dirt, snow, rain, or ice.
- · When traveling faster than 112 km/h (70 mph).

Be ready to steer and apply the brakes. For more information, see Defensive Driving 3 209 . Keep the Night Vision sensor clean and in good repair.

Night Vision Detection Unavailable and icon \ is temporarily displayed when the Night Vision system is unable to detect pedestrians or animals. It may be caused by high ambient temperatures or other conditions. The message can be dismissed and the system does not need service.

In rain, snow, or fog the image may not be clear and the direction of the road ahead may not be seen. In more severe weather conditions, the image may be unclear and unusable. The system does not need service.

Clean the night vision camera by activating the front windshield washer five times. The system will automatically try to clean itself

if a blockage is detected. If the Night Vision image still looks blurry, use a soft wet cloth to gently clean the sensor camera lens and dry thoroughly. The night vision camera is behind the lower front grille below the driver side headlamp.

If the vehicle displays SERVICE NIGHT VISION, do not attempt to adjust camera yourself. See your dealer.

## Side Blind Zone Alert (SBZA)

If equipped, the SBZA system is a lane-changing aid that assists drivers with avoiding crashes that occur with moving vehicles in the side blind zone, or blind spot areas. When the vehicle is in a forward gear, the left or right side mirror display will light up if a moving vehicle is detected in that blind zone. If the turn signal is activated and a vehicle is also detected on the same side, the display will flash as an extra warning not to change lanes. Since this system is part of the Lane Change Alert (LCA) system, read the entire LCA section before using this feature.

## Lane Change Alert (LCA)

If equipped, the Lane Change Alert (LCA) system is a lane-changing aid that can assist drivers with avoiding lane change crashes with moving vehicles in the side blind zone, or blind spot areas or with vehicles rapidly approaching these areas from behind. When a vehicle is detected in the blind zone, the LCA warning display will light up in the corresponding side mirror and will flash if the turn signal is on. The Side Blind Zone Alert (SBZA) system is included as part of the LCA system.

<!-- image -->

## Warning

LCA does not alert the driver to vehicles outside of the system detection zones, pedestrians, bicyclists, or animals. It may not provide alerts when changing lanes under all driving conditions. Failure to use proper care when changing lanes may result in injury, death, or vehicle damage. Before making a lane change, always check mirrors, glance over your shoulder, and use the turn signals.

<!-- image -->

## LCA Detection Zones

- 1. SBZA Detection Zone
- 2. LCA Detection Zone

When towing a trailer, LCA feature is disabled. When not towing a trailer, the LCA sensor covers a zone of approximately one lane over from both sides of the vehicle, or 3.5 m (11 ft). The height of the zone is approximately between 0.5 m (1.5 ft) and 2 m (6 ft) off the ground. Drivers are also warned of vehicles rapidly approaching this area up to approximately 70 m (230 ft) behind the vehicle.

## Trailer Side Blind Zone Area (TSBZA)

If equipped, the TSBZA system is a lanechanging aid that assists drivers with avoiding crashes that occur with moving vehicles in the side blind zone, or blind spot areas. The trailer

side blind zone area adds the blind zone area along the side of a trailer that the host vehicle is pulling.

When the vehicle is in a forward gear, the left or right side mirror display will light up if a moving vehicle is detected in that trailer blind zone. If the turn signal is activated and a vehicle is also detected on the same side, the display will flash as an extra warning not to change lanes. Since this system is part of the Lane Change Alert system, read the entire Lane Change Alert section before using this feature.

<!-- image -->

## Warning

TSBZA does not alert the driver to vehicles outside of the system detection zones, pedestrians, bicyclists, or animals. It may not provide alerts when changing lanes under all driving conditions. Failure to use proper care when changing lanes may result in injury, death, or vehicle damage. Before making a lane change, always check mirrors, glance over your shoulder, and use the turn signals.

<!-- image -->

## TSBZA Detection Zones

- 1. SBZA Detection Zone
- 2. TSBZA Detection Zone
- 3. LCA Detection Zone

The Side Blind Zone Alert (SBZA) warning area starts at approximately the middle of the vehicle and goes back 5 m (16 ft). The Trailer Side Blind Zone Alert (TSBZA) warning area starts at approximately 3 m (10 ft) to the trailing edge of the vehicle and goes back up to 21 m (69 ft) behind the vehicle. The maximum trailer length is 12 m (39 ft).

## How the System Works

The LCA/TSBZA symbol lights up in the side mirrors when the system detects a moving vehicle in the next lane over that is in the trailer side blind zone. This indicates it may be unsafe

to change lanes. Before making a lane change, check the SBZA display, check mirrors, glance over your shoulder, and use the turn signals.

<!-- image -->

## Left Side Mirror Display

## Right Side Mirror Display

When the vehicle is started, both outside mirror LCA/TSBZA displays will briefly come on to indicate the system is operating. When the vehicle is in a forward gear, the left- or right-side mirror display will light up if a moving vehicle is detected in that blind zone. If the turn signal is activated in the same direction as a detected vehicle, this display will flash as an extra warning not to change lanes.

LCA/TSBZA displays may not come on when passing a vehicle quickly, or when passing a stopped vehicle. LCA/TSBZA may alert to objects attached to the vehicle, such as a bicycle, or object extending out to either side of the vehicle or trailer. This is normal system operation; the vehicle does not need service.

<!-- image -->

LCA/TSBZA can be disabled through vehicle settings. To view available settings from the infotainment screen, touch Settings > Vehicle > Collision/Detection Systems. If SBZA is disabled by the driver, the TSBZA mirror displays will not light up.

## When the System Does Not Seem to Work Properly

LCA/TSBZA displays may not come on when passing a vehicle quickly, or when passing a stopped vehicle. The LCA/TSBZA detection zones that extend back from the side of the vehicle do not move further back when a trailer is towed. Use caution while changing lanes when towing a trailer. LCA/TSBZA may alert to objects attached to the vehicle, such as a trailer, bicycle, or object extending out to either side of the vehicle or trailer. This is normal system operation; the vehicle does not need service.

LCA/TSBZA may not always alert the driver to vehicles in the side blind zone, especially in wet conditions. The system does not need to be serviced. The system may light up due to guardrails, signs, trees, shrubs, and other non-moving objects. This is normal system operation; the vehicle does not need service.

LCA/TSBZA may not operate when the LCA/ TSBZA sensors in the left or right corners of the rear bumper are covered with mud, dirt, snow, ice, or slush, or in heavy rainstorms. For cleaning instructions, see "Washing the Vehicle" under Exterior Care 3 416 . If the DIC displays the system unavailable message after cleaning both sides of the vehicle toward the rear corners of the vehicle, see your dealer.

If the DIC displays the system unavailable message after cleaning both sides of the vehicle toward the rear corners of the vehicle, see your dealer

If the LCA/TSBZA displays do not light up when vehicles are in the blind zone and the system is clean, the system may need service. Take the vehicle to your dealer.

When TSBZA is disabled for any reason other than the driver turning it off, the Trailer Side Blind Zone Alert On option will not be available on the personalization menu.

## Driving with a Trailer

Although this system is intended to help drivers avoid lane change crashes, it does not replace driver vision and therefore should be considered a lane change aid. Even with the TSBZA system, the driver must check carefully

for objects outside of the reporting zone (e.g., a fast approaching vehicle) or vehicle along the side of the trailer before changing lanes.

Use caution while changing lanes when towing a trailer.

## Traffic Sign Assistant

Traffic sign assistant recognizes designated traffic signs via the front camera located behind the windshield in front of the interior rear view mirror, and displays the detected speed limit in the Driver Information Center (DIC). Traffic Sign Assistant requires an active OnStar subscription. Additionally, speed limit information from the navigation system map database may be used.

## Caution

The system is intended to assist the driver within a defined speed range to discern certain traffic signs. Always pay attention to posted speed limit signs.

Do not ignore traffic signs which are not displayed by the system.

(Continued)

## Caution (Continued)

The system does not discern any signs other than the conventional traffic signs that might give or end a speed limit. It may not detect some electronic speed signs.

Depending on the weather conditions or problems with traffic signs, a traffic sign may not be recognized or a sign different from the actual traffic sign may be displayed.

Do not let this special feature tempt you into taking risks when driving.

Always adapt vehicle speed to the road conditions.

Driver assistance systems do not relieve the driver from full responsibility for vehicle operation.

## Traffic signs that are detected are:

- · Constraint Signs
- · Speed Limit

## Display Indication

The currently detected speed limit is displayed in the DIC until the next speed limit or end of speed limit sign is detected.

The current valid speed limit is displayed

permanently in the lower line of the DIC or upper left of the instrument cluster, depending on the vehicle. If a speed sign with an add on sign is detected, a 1 symbol is also displayed. The indication of multiple signs on the display is possible. A (--) symbol in a frame indicates there is a sign detected which cannot be clearly identified by the system.

See Instrument Cluster 3 108 .

## Alert Function

If equipped, a chime may sound when you have exceeded the indicated speed limit, or if a new speed limit is detected.

The alert function can be turned on or off. To view available settings from the infotainment screen, touch Settings > Display > Instrument Cluster.

Each time the vehicle is started, the customization options will be turned on.

## System Reset

The content of the traffic sign display can be cleared in the Traffic Sign Menu from the Traffic Sign Memory page by selecting Reset and confirmed by pressing the thumbwheel. Upon successful reset, a (--) symbol displays until the next traffic sign is detected or provided by the navigation system map data. In some cases, traffic sign memory is cleared automatically by the system.

## Navigation System Traffic Sign Detection

The currently displayed sign can either originate from sign detection using the camera, or from the navigation system map data. If the currently displayed sign originates from map data and the map information changes, a new sign will be displayed. This may lead to detection of a new sign although no sign on the road may have been passed.

## Limitations

Traffic sign memory may not operate correctly if:

- · The area of the windshield, where the front camera is located, is not clean or is affected by foreign objects, e.g. stickers, window tinting, etc.
- · Traffic signs are completely or partially covered, are too low or high or difficult to discern.
- · Traffic signs do not comply with the approved traffic sign standards.
- · Traffic signs are incorrectly mounted or are damaged.
- · The speed limit is displayed by certain types of electronic speed signs.
- · The headlights are dirty or not correctly aligned when driving at night.
- · There are adverse environmental conditions, e.g. heavy rain, snow, direct sunlight or shadows.
- · The navigation map data is out of date.

## Lane Keep Assist (LKA)

If equipped, LKA may help avoid crashes due to unintentional lane departures. This system uses a camera to detect lane markings. The LKA system can be ready to assist at speeds between approximately 60 km/h (37 mph) and 180  km/h (112 mph). On some vehicles, the system will instead operate above 50 km/h (31 mph). LKA may assist by gently turning the steering wheel if the vehicle approaches

a detected lane marking. It may also provide a Lane Departure Warning (LDW) alert if the vehicle crosses a detected lane marking. This system is not intended to keep the vehicle centered in the lane. LKA will not assist and alert if the turn signal is active, or if it detects that you are accelerating, braking or actively steering. LKA can be overridden by turning the steering wheel. If the system detects you are steering intentionally across a lane marker, the LDW will not be given. Do not expect the LDW to occur when you are intentionally crossing a lane marker.

<!-- image -->

## Warning

The LKA system does not continuously steer the vehicle. It may not keep the vehicle in the lane or give a Lane Departure Warning (LDW) alert, even if a lane marking is detected.

The LKA and LDW systems may not:

- · Provide an alert or enough steering assist to avoid a lane departure or crash.

(Continued)

## Warning (Continued)

- · Detect lane markings under poor weather or visibility conditions. This can occur if the windshield or headlamps are blocked by dirt, snow, or ice; if they are not in proper condition; or if the sun shines directly into the camera.
- · Detect lanes on winding or hilly roads.
- · Detect road edges.

If LKA only detects lane markings on one side of the road, it will only assist or provide an LDW alert when approaching the lane on the side where it has detected a lane marking. Even with LKA and LDW, you must steer the vehicle. Always keep your attention on the road and maintain proper vehicle position within the lane, or vehicle damage, injury, or death could occur. Always keep the windshield, headlamps, and camera sensors clean and in good repair. Do not use LKA in bad weather conditions or on roads with unclear lane markings, such as construction zones.

<!-- image -->

## Warning

Using LKA on slippery roads could cause loss of control of the vehicle and a crash. Turn the system off.

<!-- image -->

## Warning

LKA will not alert the driver if a towed trailer crosses into an adjacent lane of travel. Serious injury or property damage may occur if the trailer moves into another lane. Always monitor the trailer position while towing to make sure it is within the same lane as the tow vehicle.

## How the System Works

LKA uses a camera sensor installed on the windshield ahead of the rearview mirror to detect lane markings. It may provide brief steering assist if it detects an unintended lane departure.  It may further provide an audible alert or the driver seat may pulse indicating that a lane marking has been crossed. The system does not provide a Lane Departure Warning (LDW) when intentionally steering across a lane marker.

To turn LKA on and off, press A on the center console. If equipped, the indicator light on the button comes on when LKA is on and turns off when LKA is disabled. On some vehicles, a long press of over three seconds is required to turn LKA off.

LKA may not be available in extremely cold temperatures of less than approximately -30° f (-34° c).

LKA is not available when the vehicle is in Terrain, Snow/Ice, or Off-Road Mode.

When on, A is white, if equipped, indicating that the system is not ready to assist. A is green if LKA is ready to assist. LKA may assist by gently turning the steering wheel if the vehicle approaches a detected lane marking. A is amber when assisting. It may also provide a Lane Departure Warning (LDW) alert by flashing A amber if the vehicle crosses a detected lane marking. Additionally, there may be three beeps, or the driver seat may pulse three times, on the right or left, depending on the lane departure direction.

## Take Steering

The LKA system does not continuously steer the vehicle. If LKA does not detect active driver steering, an alert and chime may be provided. Steer the vehicle to dismiss. LKA may become temporarily unavailable after repeated take steering alerts.

<!-- image -->

If your vehicle is equipped with Super Cruise or Lane Centering Assistance, hold the steering wheel in the indicated areas to help prevent unwanted take steering alerts.

## When the System Does Not Seem to Work Properly

The system performance may be affected by:

- · Sudden lighting changes, such as when driving through tunnels
- · Close vehicles ahead
- · Banked roads
- · Roads with poor lane markings, such as two-lane roads

If the LKA system is not functioning properly when lane markings are clearly visible, cleaning the windshield may help.

A camera blocked message may display if the camera is blocked. Some driver assistance systems may have reduced performance or not work at all. An LKA or LDW unavailable message may display if the systems are temporarily unavailable. This message could be due to a blocked camera. The LKA system does not need service. Clean the outside of the windshield behind the rearview mirror.

LKA assistance and/or LDW alerts may occur due to tar marks, shadows, cracks in the road, temporary or construction lane markings, or other road imperfections. This

is normal system operation; the vehicle does not need service. Turn LKA off if these conditions continue.

## Surround Vision Recorder

## Trailer Towing

## General Towing Information

Only use towing equipment that has been designed for the vehicle. Contact your dealer or trailering dealer for assistance with preparing the vehicle to tow a trailer. Read the entire section before towing a trailer.

To tow a disabled vehicle, see Transporting a Disabled Vehicle 3 411 . To tow the vehicle behind another vehicle such as a motor home, see Recreational Vehicle Towing 3 412 .

## Driving Characteristics and Towing Tips

<!-- image -->

## Warning

You can lose control when towing a trailer if the correct equipment is not used or the vehicle is not driven properly. For example, if the trailer is too heavy or the trailer brakes are inadequate for the load, the vehicle may not stop as expected. You and others could be seriously injured. The vehicle may also be damaged, and the repairs would not be covered by the vehicle warranty. Pull a trailer only if all the steps in this section have been followed. Ask your dealer for advice and information about towing a trailer with the vehicle.

## Driving with a Trailer

Trailering is different than just driving the vehicle by itself. Trailering affects handling, acceleration, braking, durability, and fuel economy. Successful and safe trailering requires the proper use of correct equipment.

The following information has many timetested, important trailering tips and safety rules. Many of these are important for your safety and that of your passengers. Read this section carefully before towing a trailer.

When towing a trailer:

- · State laws may require the use of extended side view mirrors. If your visibility is limited or restricted while towing, install extended side view mirrors on your vehicle, even if not required.
- · Become familiar with, and follow all state and local laws that apply to trailer towing. These requirements vary from state to state.
- · Do not tow a trailer during the first 800 km (500 mi) of vehicle use to prevent damage to the vehicle.
- · Perform the first oil change before heavy towing.

- · Do not drive over 80 km/h (50 mph) and do not make starts at full acceleration during the first 800 km (500 mi) of trailer towing.
- · Tow in D (Drive). Tow/Haul Mode is recommended for heavier trailers. See Driver Mode Control 3 244 . If the transmission downshifts too often, a lower gear may be selected using Manual Mode. See Manual Mode 3 232 Manual Mode (V-Series) 3 233 .

If equipped, the following driver assistance features should be turned off when towing a trailer, and may turn off automatically when a trailer is detected:

- · Reverse Automatic Braking (RAB)
- · Park Assist
- · Rear Cross Traffic Alert (RCTA)
- · Lane Change Alert (LCA)
- · Rear Cross Traffic Braking
- · Super Cruise and Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), unless equipped with trailering functionality, see Adaptive Cruise Control (Advanced) 3 252 .

Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB), and Front Pedestrian Braking (FPB) should be set to Alert unless equipped with Super Cruise. Do not use Automatic Parking Assist (APA) while towing a trailer.

<!-- image -->

## Warning

To prevent serious injury or death from carbon monoxide (CO), when towing a trailer:

- · Fully open the air outlets on or under the instrument panel.
- · Do not drive with the liftgate, trunk/ hatch, or rear-most window open.
- · Adjust the climate control system to a setting that brings in only outside air. See 'Climate Control Systems' in the Index.

For more information about carbon monoxide, see Engine Exhaust 3 228 .

Towing a trailer requires experience. The combination of the vehicle and trailer is longer and not as responsive as the vehicle itself.

Become familiar with handling and braking by driving on a level road surface before driving on public roads.

The trailer structure, the tires, and the brakes must be all be rated to carry the intended cargo. Inadequate trailer equipment can cause the combination to operate in an unexpected or unsafe manner. Before driving, inspect all trailer hitch parts and attachments, safety chains, electrical connectors, lamps, tires, and mirrors. See Towing Equipment 3 319 . If the trailer has electric brakes, start the combination moving and then manually apply the trailer brake controller to check the trailer brakes work. During the trip, occasionally check that the cargo and trailer are secure and that the lamps and any trailer brakes are working.

## Towing with a Stability Control System

When towing, the stability control system might be heard. The system reacts to vehicle movement caused by the trailer, which mainly occurs during cornering. This is normal when towing heavier trailers.

## Following Distance

Stay at least twice as far behind the vehicle ahead as you would when driving without a trailer. This can help to avoid heavy braking and sudden turns.

## Passing

More passing distance is needed when towing a trailer. The combination of the vehicle and trailer will not accelerate as quickly and is much longer than the vehicle alone. It is necessary to go much farther beyond the passed vehicle before returning to the lane. Pass on level roadways. Avoid passing on hills if possible.

## Backing Up

Hold the bottom of the steering wheel with one hand. To move the trailer to the left, move that hand to the left. To move the trailer to the right, move that hand to the right. Always back up slowly and, if possible, have someone guide you.

## Making Turns

## Caution

Turn more slowly and make wider arcs when towing a trailer to prevent damage to your vehicle. Making very sharp turns could cause the trailer to contact the vehicle.

Make wider turns than normal when towing, so trailer will not go over soft shoulders, over curbs, or strike road signs, trees, or other objects. Always signal turns well in advance. Do not steer or brake suddenly.

## Driving on Grades

Reduce speed and shift to a lower gear before starting down a long or steep downhill grade. If the transmission is not shifted down, the brakes may overheat and result in reduced braking efficiency.

The vehicle can tow in D (Drive). Shift the transmission to a lower gear if the transmission shifts too often under heavy loads and/or hilly conditions.

When towing at higher altitudes, engine coolant will boil at a lower temperature than at lower altitudes. If the engine is turned off

immediately after towing at high altitude on steep uphill grades, the vehicle could show signs similar to engine overheating. To avoid this, let the engine run, preferably on level ground, with the transmission in P (Park) for a few minutes before turning the engine off. If the overheat warning comes on, see Engine Overheating 3 357 .

## Parking on Hills

<!-- image -->

## Warning

To prevent serious injury or death, always park your vehicle and trailer on a level surface when possible.

When parking your vehicle and your trailer on a hill:

- 1. Press and hold the brake pedal, but do not shift into P (Park). Turn the wheels toward the curb if facing downhill or into traffic if facing uphill.
- 2. Have someone place chocks under the trailer wheels.
- 3. When the wheel chocks are in place, gradually release the brake pedal to allow the chocks to absorb the load of the trailer.

- 4. Reapply the brake pedal. Then apply the parking brake and shift into P (Park).
- 5. Release the brake pedal.

## Leaving After Parking on a Hill

- 1. Apply and hold the brake pedal.
- · Shift into the desired gear.
- · Start the engine.
- · Release the parking brake.
- 2. Let up on the brake pedal.
- 3. Drive slowly until the trailer is clear of the chocks.
- 4. Stop and have someone pick up and store the chocks.

## Launching and Retrieving a Boat Backing the Trailer into the Water

<!-- image -->

{

## Warning

- · Have all passengers get out of the vehicle before backing onto the sloped part of the ramp. Lower the driver and passenger side windows before backing onto the ramp. This will provide a means of escape in the unlikely event the vehicle slides into the water.
- · Do not move the vehicle if someone is in the path of the trailer. Some parts of the trailer might be underwater and not visible to people who are assisting in launching the boat.
- · If the boat launch surface is slippery, have  the driver remain in the vehicle with the brake pedal applied while the boat is being launched. The boat launch can be especially slippery at low tide when part of the ramp was previously submerged at high tide. Do not back onto the ramp to launch the boat if you are not sure the vehicle can maintain traction.

Disconnect the wiring to the trailer before backing the trailer into the water to prevent damage to the electrical circuits on the trailer. Reconnect the wiring to the trailer after removing the trailer from the water. If the trailer has electric brakes that can function when the trailer is submerged, it might help to leave the electrical trailer connector attached to maintain trailer brake functionality while on the boat ramp.

To back the trailer into the water:

- 1. If equipped, place the vehicle in Four-Wheel Drive High or Automatic Four-Wheel Drive.
- 2. Slowly back down the boat ramp until the boat is floating, but no further than necessary.
- 3. Press and hold the brake pedal, but do not shift into P (Park) yet.
- 4. Have someone place chocks under the front wheels of the vehicle.
- 5. Gradually release the brake pedal to allow the chocks to absorb the load of the trailer.
- 6. Reapply the brake pedal. Then apply the parking brake and shift into P (Park).
- 7. Release the brake pedal.

## Pulling the Trailer from the Water

- 1. Press and hold the brake pedal.
- 2. Start the engine and shift into a gear.
- 3. Release the parking brake.
- 4. Let up on the brake pedal.
- 5. Drive slowly until the tires are clear of the chocks.
- 6. Stop and have someone pick up and store the chocks.
- 7. Slowly pull the trailer from the water.
- 8. Once the vehicle and trailer have been driven from the sloped part of the boat ramp, the vehicle can be shifted from fourwheel-drive high. Shift into the drive mode that is appropriate for the road conditions.

## Caution

If the vehicle tires begin to spin and the vehicle  begins to slide toward the water, remove your foot from the accelerator pedal and apply the brake pedal. Seek help to have the vehicle towed up the ramp.

## Maintenance when Trailer Towing

The vehicle needs service more often when used to tow trailers. See Maintenance Schedule 3 426 . It is especially important to check the engine oil, axle lubricant, belts, cooling system, and brake system before and during each trip.

Check periodically that all nuts and bolts on the trailer hitch are tight.

## Engine Cooling when Trailer Towing

The cooling system may temporarily overheat during severe operating conditions. See Engine Overheating 3 357 .

## Trailer Towing

If equipped with a diesel engine, see the Duramax diesel supplement.

## Caution

Towing a trailer improperly can damage the vehicle and result in costly repairs not covered by the vehicle warranty. To tow a trailer correctly, follow the directions in this section and see your dealer for important information about towing a trailer with the vehicle.

Trailering is different than just driving the vehicle by itself. Trailering means changes in handling, acceleration, braking, durability, and fuel economy. Successful, safe trailering takes correct equipment, and it has to be used properly.

The following information has many timetested, important trailering tips and safety rules. Many of these are important for your safety and that of your passengers. Read this section carefully before pulling a trailer.

## Trailer Weight

<!-- image -->

{

## Warning

Never exceed the towing capacity for your vehicle.

Safe trailering requires monitoring the weight, speed, altitude, road grades, outside temperature, dimensions of the front of the trailer, and how frequently the vehicle is used to tow a trailer.

## Trailering Weight Ratings

When towing a trailer, the combined weight of the vehicle, vehicle contents, trailer, and trailer contents must be below all of the maximum weight ratings for the vehicle, including:

- · Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (GVWR)
- · Gross Combined Weight Rating (GCWR)
- · Maximum Trailer Weight Rating
- · Maximum Trailer Tongue Weight Rating
- · Gross Axle Weight Rating-Rear (GAWR-RR)

See 'Weight-Distributing Hitch Adjustment' under Towing Equipment 3 319 to determine if equalizer bars are required to obtain the maximum trailer weight rating.

See 'Trailer Brakes' under Towing Equipment 3 319 to determine if brakes are required based on the trailer weight.

The only way to be sure the weight is not exceeding any of these ratings is to weigh the tow vehicle and trailer combination, fully loaded for the trip, getting individual weights for each of these items.

A trailering information label on the driver side door center pillar (B-pillar) shows tow rating information for your vehicle.

<!-- image -->

## Warning

You and others could be seriously injured or killed if the trailer is too heavy or the trailer brakes are inadequate for the load. The vehicle may be damaged, and the repairs would not be covered by the vehicle warranty.

Only tow a trailer if all the steps in this section have been followed. Ask your dealer for advice and information about towing a trailer.

## Gross Combined Weight Rating (GCWR)

GCWR is the total allowable weight of the completely loaded vehicle and trailer including any fuel, passengers, cargo, equipment, and accessories. Do not exceed the GCWR for your vehicle. The GCWR for the vehicle is on the Trailering Information Label.

To check that the weight of the vehicle and trailer are within the GCWR for the vehicle, follow these steps:

- 1. Start with the "curb weight" from the Trailering Information Label.
- 2. Add the weight of the trailer loaded with cargo and ready for the trip.
- 3. Add the weight of all passengers.
- 4. Add the weight of all cargo in the vehicle.
- 5. Add the weight of hitch hardware such as a draw bar, ball, load equalizer bars, or sway bars.
- 6. Add the weight of any accessories or aftermarket equipment added to the vehicle.

The resulting weight cannot exceed the GCWR value shown on the Trailering Information Label.

The GCWR can also be confirmed by weighing the vehicle and trailer on a public scale. The vehicle and trailer should be loaded for the trip with passengers and cargo.

<!-- image -->

## Gross Combined Weight (GCW) Alert

If equipped, the GCW Alert can display a message, in the Driver Information Center (DIC).

Vehicle-Trailer May Be Over GCW Rating: This message indicates that the estimated combined weight of the vehicle and trailer is high enough that the combined weight should be confirmed on a scale to make sure the GCWR is not exceeded.

Vehicle-Trailer Is Over GCW Rating: This message indicates that the estimated combined weight of the vehicle and trailer is high enough that it is likely that the vehicle's GCWR has been exceeded. The combined weight of the vehicle and trailer should be confirmed on a scale and reduced if necessary. See "Gross Combined Weight Rating." The vehicle does not actually measure the loaded weight of your vehicle or trailer. It uses vehicle data to estimate these weights after you begin a trip.

The alert will not activate unless:

- · The feature is turned on in the Trailering application, see Trailering App 3 330 ; and
- · The vehicle-trailer combination is driven with enough acceleration events for the software algorithm to estimate the combined vehicle and trailer weight; and:
- · The estimated weight is high enough to trigger the alert.

If you see the alert message, stop the vehicle when it is safe and check whether the vehicle and trailer are overloaded using a scale. See 'Maximum Trailer Weight' below.

<!-- image -->

## Warning

Always determine the actual weights of the loaded vehicle and trailer using a vehicle scale before beginning a trip. Never use the GCW Alert to determine whether the vehicle and trailer are properly loaded or overloaded. Do not drive with an overloaded vehicle or trailer. Death, serious injury, or property damage could occur.

GCWR is only one of the maximum weight ratings applicable to your vehicle and trailer. The GCW Alert does not estimate whether the vehicle alone exceeds the GVWR, the rear-axle weight exceeds GAWR-RR, the trailer exceeds the maximum trailer weight rating or the

trailer tongue weight exceeds the maximum trailer tongue weight rating. Always verify that the weight of the vehicle, vehicle contents, trailer, trailer contents and trailer tongue are below all of these maximum weight ratings. See "Maximum Trailer Weight" section below.

## Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (GVWR)

For information about the vehicle maximum load capacity, see Vehicle Load Limits 3 218 . When calculating the GVWR with a trailer attached, the trailer tongue weight must be included as part of the weight the vehicle is carrying.

## Maximum Trailer Weight

The maximum trailer weight rating is calculated assuming the tow vehicle has a driver, a front seat passenger, and all required trailering equipment. This value represents the heaviest trailer the vehicle can tow, but it may be necessary to reduce the trailer weight to stay within the GCWR, GVWR, maximum trailer tongue load, or GAWR-RR for the vehicle.

Use the Trailering Information Label to determine how much the trailer can weigh.

## Maximum Trailer Tongue Weight Rating

The Maximum Trailer Tongue Weight Rating is the allowable trailer tongue weight that the vehicle can support using a conventional trailer hitch. It may be necessary to reduce the overall trailer weight to stay within the maximum trailer tongue weight rating while still maintaining the correct trailer load balance.

<!-- image -->

The Maximum Trailer Tongue Weight Rating for a conventional trailer hitch is shown on the Trailering Information Label.

Do not exceed a maximum trailer tongue weight of 567 kg (1,250 lb) for a conventional trailer hitch.

The trailer tongue weight contributes to the Gross Vehicle Weight (GVW). GVW includes the curb weight of your vehicle, any passengers, cargo, equipment and the trailer tongue weight. Vehicle options, passengers, cargo, and equipment reduce the maximum allowable tongue weight the vehicle can carry, which also reduces the maximum allowable trailer weight.

## Trailer Load Balance

The correct trailer load balance must be maintained to ensure trailer stability. Incorrect load balance is a leading cause of trailer sway.

<!-- image -->

The trailer tongue weight (1) should be 10-15% of the total loaded trailer weight (2). Some specific trailer types, such as boat trailers, fall

outside of this range. Always refer to the trailer owner's manual for the recommended trailer tongue weight for each trailer. Never exceed the maximum loads for your vehicle, hitch and trailer.

The trailer load balance percentage is calculated as: weight (1) divided by weight (2) times 100.

After loading the trailer, separately weigh the trailer and then the trailer tongue and calculate the trailer load balance percentage to see if the weights and distribution are appropriate for your vehicle. If the trailer weight is too high, it may be possible to transfer some of the cargo into your vehicle. If the trailer tongue weight is too high or too low, it may be possible to rearrange some of the cargo inside of the trailer.

Do not exceed the maximum allowable tongue weight for your vehicle. Use the shortest hitch extension available to position the hitch ball closer to your vehicle. This will help reduce the effect of the trailer tongue weight on the trailer hitch and the rear axle.

If a cargo carrier is used in the trailer hitch receiver, choose a carrier that positions the load as close to the vehicle as possible. Make sure the total weight, including the carrier, is

no more than half of the maximum allowable tongue weight for the vehicle or 227 kg (500 lb), whichever is less.

## Rear Gross Axle Weight Rating (GAWR-RR)

The GAWR-RR is the total weight that can be supported by the rear axle of the vehicle. Do not exceed the GAWR-RR for the vehicle, with the tow vehicle and trailer fully loaded for the trip including the weight of the trailer tongue. If using a weight-distributing hitch, do not exceed the GAWR-RR after applying the weight distribution spring bars.

<!-- image -->

The GAWR-RR for the vehicle is on the Trailering Information Label.

For additional assistance with trailering or additional information, see your dealer.

## Towing Equipment

## Hitches

<!-- image -->

## Warning

In order to avoid serious injury or property damage, always follow the hitch manufacturer's instructions when securing your draw bar/coupling device to the vehicle's hitch receiver.

Ensure that the draw bar/coupling device is secured with a locking retainer pin or other means such that rotation of the pin or locking mechanism will not cause the pin to back out or loosen during use. Failure to correctly secure the draw bar/coupling device to the receiver can result in separation of the hitch/receiver while towing.

## Conventional Hitch

A conventional hitch is bolted to the frame or cross member of the tow vehicle, and is generally rated Class 2, 3, 4, or 5.

Always use the correct hitch equipment for your vehicle. Crosswinds, large trucks going by, and rough roads can affect the trailer and the hitch.

Proper hitch equipment for your vehicle helps maintain control of the vehicle-trailer combination. Many trailers can be towed using a weight-carrying hitch which has a coupler latched to the hitch ball, or a tow eye latched to a pintle hook. Other trailers may require a weight-distributing hitch that uses spring bars to distribute the trailer tongue weight between your vehicle and trailer axles. See 'Maximum Trailer Tongue Weight Rating' under Trailer Towing 3 315 for weight limits with various hitch types.

Never attach rental hitches or other bumpertype hitches. Only use frame-mounted hitches that do not attach to the bumper.

## Hitch Cover

<!-- image -->

To remove hitch cover, if equipped:

- 1. Remove the two fasteners on the lower tabs (2).
- 2. Pull the lower edge of the cover to about a 45-degree angle.
- 3. Pull the cover upward to disengage the upper attachments (1).

To reinstall hitch cover:

- 1. Hold cover at a 45-degree angle to the vehicle and push the upper tabs into the slots in the bumper.
- 2. Push the bottom of the cover forward until the lower tabs line up with the lower slots.
- 3. Snap the hitch cover into place by pushing the upper corners forward (1).
- 4. Reinstall the two fasteners on the lower tabs (2).

Consider using mechanical sway controls with any trailer. Ask a trailering professional about sway controls or refer to the trailer manufacturer's recommendations and instructions.

## Weight-Distributing Hitch Adjustment

A weight-distributing hitch may be useful with some trailers. Use the following guidelines to determine if a weight-distributing hitch should be used.

| Trailer Weight            | Weight-Distributing Hitch Usage   | Hitch Distribution   |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------|
| Up to 2 720 kg (6,000 lb) | Not Required                      | 50%                  |
| Over 2 720 kg (6,000 lb)  | Required                          | 50%                  |

<!-- image -->

- 1. Front of Vehicle
- 2. H1/H2 Body to Ground Distance

## Towing

- 1. Position the truck so that the trailer is ready to connect (Keep trailer detached).
- 2. Measure the height of the top of the front wheel opening at the fender to the ground (H1).
- 3. Attach the vehicle to the trailer, do not attach weight distribution bars at this time.
- 4. Measure the height of the top of the front wheel opening on the fender to the ground (H2).
- 5. Install and adjust the tension in the weight distributing bars per the manufacturer's recommendations so that the height of the front fender is approximately H2[(H2-H1)/2] (half way between the two measured ride heights).
- 6. Visually inspect the trailer and weight distributing hitch to ensure that the manufacturer's recommendations have been met.

| Measurement    |   Height Example 1500 (mm) |

## Leveling the Trailer

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## Warning

Always level the trailer front-to-back using the correct trailer hitch drawbar. Towing with a trailer that is not level can result in incorrect loading of trailer axles, springs, and tires, which can lead to trailer sway, trailer damage, and/or trailer tire blowouts resulting in an accident causing potential injury and/or death. Do not attempt to tow a trailer that is not level.

Select the correct hitch drawbar rise (1) or drop (2) to level the trailer.

## Tires

- · Tires must be properly inflated to support loads while towing a trailer. See Tires 3 377 for instructions on proper tire inflation.
- · Do not tow a trailer while using a compact spare tire on the vehicle.

## Safety Chains

Always attach chains between the vehicle and the trailer, and attach the chains to the holes on the trailer hitch platform. Instructions about safety chains may be provided by the hitch manufacturer or by the trailer manufacturer.

Cross the safety chains under the tongue of the trailer to help prevent the tongue from contacting the road if it becomes separated from the hitch. Always leave just enough slack so the combination can turn. Never allow safety chains to drag on the ground.

## Trailer Brakes

Loaded trailers over 900 kg (2,000 lb) must be equipped with brake systems and with brakes for each axle. Trailer braking equipment

conforming to Canadian Standards Association (CSA) requirement CAN3-D313, or its equivalent, is recommended.

State or local regulations may require trailers to have their own braking system if the loaded weight of the trailer exceeds certain minimums that can vary from state to state. Read and follow the instructions for the trailer brakes so they are installed, adjusted, and maintained properly. Never attempt to tap into your vehicle's hydraulic brake system. If you do, both the vehicle anti-lock brakes and the trailer brakes may not function, which could result in a crash.

## Trailer Wiring Harness

The seven-pin trailer connector is mounted in the bumper. This connector can be plugged into a seven-pin universal heavy-duty trailer connector available through your dealer.

Use only a round, seven-wire connector with flat blade terminals meeting SAE J2863 specifications for proper electrical connectivity.

The seven-wire harness contains the following trailer circuits:

- · Yellow/Grey: Left Stop/Turn Signal
- · Green/Violet: Right Stop/Turn Signal
- · White: Ground
- · Grey/Brown: Taillamps
- · White/Green: Back-up Lamps
- · Dark Blue: Trailer Brake
- · Red/Green: Battery Feed

To help charge a remote (non-vehicle) battery, change drive mode to Tow Haul. If the trailer is too light for Tow/Haul Mode, turn on the headlamps to help charge the battery.

## Electric Brake Control Wiring Provisions

These wiring provisions are included with the vehicle as part of the trailer wiring package. These provisions are for an electric brake controller.

The harness should be installed by your dealer or a qualified service center.

Refer to the aftermarket electric trailer brake controller owner's manual to determine wire color coding of the electric trailer brake controller. The wire colors on the brake controller may be different from the vehicle.

## Trailer Lamps

Always check that all trailer lamps are working at the beginning of each trip, and periodically on longer trips.

If equipped, the Trailering App will monitor the right-hand (RH) turn/brake circuit, lefthand (LH) turn/brake circuit, running lamp circuit, and reverse lamp circuits on the trailer. Driver Information Center (DIC) messages and Trailering App alerts display if lighting circuit issues are detected on the trailer.

When trailers cannot be detected, the trailerrelated DIC messages and/or Trailering App alerts will not display.

Pressing START LIGHT TEST in the Trailering App automatically activates trailer lamps. The Trailering App is not a substitute for manually inspecting your trailer lamps. See Trailering App 3 330 .

## Trailer Connection and Lamp Messages

When a trailer is properly connected and working, no trailer connection or lamp messages appear on the DIC. However; if the vehicle detects an issue with a trailer connection or lamp, you may see the following DIC message(s):

- · TRAILER DISCONNECTED CHECK CONNECTION appears when a connected trailer is disconnected. It appears immediately when the vehicle is on, or upon the next start-up if the trailer was disconnected while the vehicle was off. Check the trailer connection as appropriate.
- · CHECK TRAILER XXX LAMP appears when there is a detected lamp or wiring fault on the trailer. Check the trailer wiring and lamps.

## Turn Signals When Towing a Trailer

When properly connected, the trailer turn signals should will illuminate to indicate the vehicle is turning, changing lanes, or stopping. When towing a trailer, the arrows on the instrument cluster will illuminate even if the trailer is not properly connected or the bulbs are burned out.

## Tow/Haul Mode

For instructions on how to enter Tow/Haul mode, see Driver Mode Control 3 244 .

Tow/Haul assists when pulling a heavy trailer or a large or heavy load.

Tow/Haul Mode is designed to be most effective when the vehicle and trailer combined weight is at least 75% of the vehicle's Gross Combined Weight Rating (GCWR). See 'Maximum Trailer Weight' under Trailer Towing 3 315 .

Tow/Haul Mode is most useful when towing a heavy trailer or carrying a large or heavy load:

- · In stop-and-go traffic
- · Through rolling terrain
- · In busy parking lots

Operating the vehicle in Tow/Haul Mode when lightly loaded or not towing will not cause damage; however, it is not recommended and may result in unpleasant engine and transmission driving characteristics and reduced fuel economy.

## Integrated Trailer Brake Control System

The vehicle may have an Integrated Trailer Brake Control (ITBC) system for use with electric trailer brakes or most electric over hydraulic trailer brake systems. These instructions apply to both types of electric trailer brakes.

<!-- image -->

This symbol is on the Trailer Brake Control Panel on vehicles with an ITBC system. The power output to the trailer brakes is proportional to the amount of vehicle braking. This available power output to the trailer brakes can be adjusted to a wide range of trailering situations.

The ITBC system is integrated with the vehicle brakes, Antilock Brake System (ABS), and Electronic Stability Control (ESC) systems. In trailering conditions that cause the vehicle's ABS or ESC systems to activate, power sent to the trailer brakes automatically adjusts to minimize trailer wheel lock-up. This does not imply that the trailer has ESC.

If the vehicle's brakes, ABS, or ESC systems are not functioning properly, the ITBC system may not function fully or at all. Make sure all of these systems are fully operational to allow the ITBC system to function properly.

The ITBC system is powered through the vehicle's electrical system. Turning the ignition off will also turn off the ITBC system. The ITBC system is fully functional only when the ignition is in ON/RUN.

<!-- image -->

{

## Warning

Connecting a trailer that has an air brake system may result in reduced or complete loss of trailer braking, including increased stopping distance or trailer instability which could result in serious injury, death, or property damage. Only use the ITBC system with electric or electric over hydraulic trailer brake systems.

## Trailer Brake Control Panel

<!-- image -->

- 1. Manual Trailer Brake Apply Lever
- 2. Trailer Symbol
- 3. Trailer Gain Adjustment Buttons

The ITBC control panel is on the instrument panel to the left of the steering column. The control panel allows adjustment to the amount of output, referred to as trailer gain, available to the trailer brakes and allows manual application of the trailer brakes. Use the ITBC control panel and the DIC trailer brake display page to adjust and display power output to the trailer brakes.

## Trailer Brake DIC Display Page

The ITBC display page indicates:

- · Output to the trailer brakes
- · Trailer gain setting
- · Trailer connection

## To display:

- · System operational status.
- · Scroll through the DIC menu pages
- · Activate the manual trailer brake apply lever
- · Press a trailer gain (+) or (-) button

Press a trailer gain button to recall the current trailer gain setting. Each press and release of the gain buttons will then change the trailer gain setting. Press the trailer gain (+) or (-) to adjust. Press and hold to continuously adjust the trailer gain. To turn the output to the trailer off, adjust the trailer gain setting to 0.0. This setting can be adjusted from 0.0-10.0 with a trailer connected or disconnected.

TRAILER OUTPUT: This displays anytime a trailer with electric brakes is connected. Output to the trailer brakes is based on the

amount of vehicle braking present and relative to the trailer gain setting. Output is displayed from 0-100% for each gain setting.

The trailer output will indicate '- - - - - -' on the trailer brake display page whenever the following occur:

- · A trailer without electric brakes is connected, no DIC message will display
- · No trailer is connected
- · A trailer with electric brakes has become disconnected, a CHECK TRAILER WIRING message displays on the DIC
- · The ITBC system is not working due to a fault, a SERVICE TRAILER BRAKE SYSTEM message displays in the DIC
- · There is a fault present in the wiring to the trailer brakes, a CHECK TRAILER WIRING message displays on the DIC

## Manual Trailer Brake Apply Lever

Slide this lever left to apply the trailer's electric brakes independent of the vehicle brakes. Use this lever to adjust trailer gain to achieve the proper power output to the trailer brakes. This lever may also be used to request additional trailer braking at any time. The trailer and

the vehicle brake lamps will come on when either vehicle brakes or manual trailer brakes are applied and properly connected.

## Trailer Gain Adjustment Procedure

Trailer gain should be set for a specific trailering condition and it must be readjusted anytime vehicle loading, trailer loading, or road surface conditions change.

<!-- image -->

## Warning

Trailer brakes that are over-gained or undergained may not stop the vehicle and the trailer as intended and can result in a crash. Always follow the instructions to set the Trailer Gain for the proper trailer stopping performance.

To adjust trailer gain for each towing condition:

- 1. Drive the vehicle with the trailer attached on a level road surface representative of the towing condition and free of traffic at about 32-40 km/h (20-25 mph) and fully apply the manual trailer brake apply lever.

## Note

Adjusting trailer gain at speeds lower than 32-40 km/h (20-25 mph) may result in an incorrect gain setting.

- 2. Adjust the Trailer Gain, using the Trailer Gain adjustment buttons, to just below the point of trailer wheel lock-up, indicated by trailer wheel squeal or tire smoke when a trailer wheel locks.

## Note

Trailer wheel lock-up may not occur if towing a heavily loaded trailer. In this case, adjust the trailer gain to the highest allowable setting for the towing condition.

- 3. Readjust trailer gain any time vehicle loading, trailer loading, or road surface conditions change or if trailer wheel lock-up is noticed at any time while towing.

## Other ITBC-Related DIC Messages

TRAILER BRAKES CONNECTED: This message will briefly display when a trailer with electric brakes is first connected to the vehicle. This message will automatically turn off after about 10 seconds. This message can be acknowledged before it automatically turns off.

CHECK TRAILER WIRING: This message will display if:

- · The ITBC system first determines connection to a trailer with electric brakes and then the trailer harness becomes disconnected from the vehicle.
- -If the disconnect occurs while the vehicle is stationary, this message will automatically turn off in about 30 seconds. This message will also turn off if it is acknowledged or if the trailer harness is reconnected.
- -If the disconnect occurs while the vehicle is moving, this message will continue until the vehicle is turned off. This message will also turn off if it is acknowledged or if the trailer harness is reconnected.
- · There is an electrical fault in the wiring to the trailer brakes. This message will continue as long as there is an electrical fault in the trailer wiring. This message will also turn off if it is acknowledged.

To determine whether the electrical fault is on the vehicle side or trailer side of the trailer wiring harness connection:

- 1. Disconnect the trailer wiring harness from the vehicle.
- 2. Turn the vehicle off.
- 3. Wait 10 seconds, then turn the vehicle back to RUN.
- 4. If the CHECK TRAILER WIRING message reappears, the electrical fault is on the vehicle side.
- 5. If the CHECK TRAILER WIRING message only reappears when connecting the trailer wiring harness to the vehicle, the electrical fault is on the trailer side.

SERVICE TRAILER BRAKES or REDUCED TRAILER BRAKING: This message will display if the electric trailer brake performance is either reduced or non-functional.

HOLD LAST KNOWN GAIN: This message will display if it is no longer possible to adjust the trailer brake gain. Trailer brakes may or may not still be functional, and it is not possible to adjust brake gain based on road conditions. The trailer brakes may remain functional until the next time the vehicle is turned off.

TRAILER BRAKES DISABLED SERVICE REQUIRED: This message will display when there is a problem with the ITBC system. If this message continues over multiple restarts, have the vehicle serviced.

If the CHECK TRAILER WIRING, TRAILER BRAKES DISABLED SERVICE REQUIRED, SERVICE TRAILER BRAKES, or REDUCED TRAILER BRAKING message displays while driving, the ITBC system may not be fully functional or may not function at all. When traffic conditions allow, carefully pull the vehicle over to the side of the road and turn the vehicle off. Check the wiring connection to the trailer and turn the vehicle back on. If either of these messages continue, either the vehicle or trailer needs service.

<!-- image -->

## Warning

Driving while the trailer braking system is malfunctioning may increase loading on the vehicle's braking system or lead to trailer instability. Use caution. Drive slowly and allow for increased stopping distances.

A GM dealer may be able to diagnose and repair problems with the trailer. However, any diagnosis and repair of the trailer is not covered under the vehicle warranty. Contact your trailer dealer for assistance with trailer repairs and trailer warranty information.

## Trailer Sway Control (TSC)

Vehicles with Electronic Stability Control (ESC) have a Trailer Sway Control (TSC) feature. Trailer sway is unintended side-to-side motion of a trailer while towing. If the vehicle is towing a trailer and the TSC detects that sway is increasing, the vehicle brakes are selectively applied at each wheel, to help reduce excessive trailer sway. If equipped with the Integrated Trailer Brake Control (ITBC) system, and the trailer has an electric brake system, ESC may also apply the trailer brakes.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

If TSC is enabled, the TCS/ESC warning light will flash on the instrument cluster. Reduce vehicle speed by gradually removing your foot from the accelerator. If trailer sway continues, ESC can help slow the vehicle down. TSC will not function if ESC is turned off. See Traction Control/Electronic Stability Control 3 242 .

<!-- image -->

## Warning

Trailer sway can result in a crash and in serious injury or death, even if the vehicle is equipped with TSC.

If the trailer begins to sway, reduce vehicle speed by gradually removing your foot from the accelerator. Then pull over to check the trailer and vehicle to help correct possible causes, including an improperly or overloaded trailer, unrestrained cargo, improper trailer hitch configuration, or improperly inflated or incorrect vehicle

## Warning (Continued)

or trailer tires. See Towing Equipment 3 319 for trailer ratings and hitch setup recommendations.

## Aftermarket Electronic Trailer Sway Control Devices

Some trailers may come equipped with an electronic device designed to reduce or control trailer sway. Aftermarket equipment manufacturers also offer similar devices that connect to the wiring between the trailer and the vehicle. These devices may interfere with the vehicle's trailer brake systems or other systems, including integrated anti-sway systems, if equipped. Messages related to trailer connections or trailer brakes could appear on the Driver Information Center (DIC). The effects of these aftermarket devices on vehicle handling or trailer brake performance is not known.

<!-- image -->

## Warning

Use of aftermarket electronic trailer sway control devices could result in reduced trailer brake performance, loss of trailer brakes, or other malfunctions, and result in a crash. You or others could be seriously injured or killed. Before using one of these devices:

- · Before driving, check the trailer brakes are working properly, if equipped. Drive the vehicle with the trailer attached on a level road surface that is free of traffic at about 32-40 km/h (20-25 mph) and fully apply the manual trailer brake apply lever. Also, check the trailer brake lamps and other lamps are functioning correctly.
- · Ask the device or trailer manufacturer if the device has been thoroughly tested for compatibility with the make, model, and year of your vehicle and any optional equipment installed on your vehicle.

(Continued)

## Warning (Continued)

- · If the trailer brakes are not operating properly at any time, or if a DIC message indicates problems with the trailer connections or trailer brakes, carefully pull the vehicle over to the side of the road when traffic conditions allow.

## Trailer Tires

Special Trailer (ST) tires differ from vehicle tires. Trailer tires are designed with stiff sidewalls to help prevent sway and to support heavy loads. These features can make it difficult to determine if the trailer tire pressures are low only based on a visual inspection.

Always check all trailer tire pressures before each trip when the tires are cool. Low trailer tire pressure is a leading cause of trailer tire blowouts.

If the vehicle is equipped with a trailer tire pressure monitoring system, see the trailer tire pressure monitoring system description and the Trailering App 3 330 .

Trailer tires deteriorate over time. The trailer tire sidewall will show the week and year the tire was manufactured. Many trailer tire manufacturers recommend replacing tires more than six years old.

Overloading is another leading cause of trailer tire blow-outs. Never load your trailer with more weight than the tires are designed to support. The load rating is located on the trailer tire sidewall.

Always know the maximum speed rating for the trailer tires before driving. This may be significantly lower than the vehicle tire speed rating. The speed rating may be on the trailer tire sidewall. If the speed rating is not shown, the default trailer tire speed rating is 105 km/h (65 mph).

If a trailer is connected, touch the Trailer Profile name to activate a Trailer Profile.

There can be up to five Custom Trailer Profiles on the vehicle.

The Custom Trailer Profiles and Guest Trailer are in order of the most frequently used. The Accessory/No Trailer profile is shown below the Custom Trailer Profiles and Guest Trailer Profile.

All personalization features are based on the settings for each driver in vehicle personalization. The list of Trailer Profiles is based on vehicle personalization settings.

## Guest Trailer

If the Guest Trailer Profile is the active Trailer Profile, trailer detection, connections status, theft, and the Tow/Haul reminder alerts can be sent. The system will not track total mileage or fuel economy, but the system will track trip mileage and fuel economy if the Guest Trailer Profile is active. The Trailer Tire Pressure Monitoring System or maintenance reminders cannot be set up for a Guest Trailer Profile. The Guest Trailer Profile cannot be edited.

Touch p to learn more about the Guest Trailer option.

## Accessory/No Trailer

If the Accessory/No Trailer Profile is active, alerts will not be sent and the system will not track mileage or fuel economy. The Trailer Tire Pressure Monitoring System or maintenance reminders cannot be set up for the Accessory/No Trailer Profile. The Accessory/No Trailer profile cannot be edited.

## No Trailer Connected

When there is no trailer connected, Trailer Profiles cannot be activated but most options can be edited.

## Trailer Brake Gain Memory

The system can memorize the brake gain setting of a Trailer Profile or a Guest Trailer Profile. When a Trailer Profile or Guest Trailer Profile is selected, and a brake gain setting is set for that Trailer Profile, a quick notice will appear to indicate that the system has recalled that profile's brake gain setting.

If a Trailer Profile is already active and the brake gain setting had been set for that Trailer Profile, the quick notice will trigger whenever the vehicle is turned on.

If there was an error in setting the brake gain for a Trailer Profile, there will be a notification. This pop-up will not appear if the Guest Trailer Profile is active or if there is no trailer connected.

Trailer brake gain should be set for a specific trailering condition and must be adjusted anytime vehicle loading, trailer loading, or road surface conditions change.

If the oil is below the cross-hatched area at the tip of the dipstick and the engine has been off for at least 15 minutes, add 1 L (1 qt) of the recommended oil and then recheck the level. See 'Selecting the Right Engine Oil' later in this section for an explanation of what kind of oil to use. For engine oil crankcase capacity, see Capacities and Specifications 3 436 .

## Caution

Do not add too much oil. Oil levels above or below the acceptable operating range shown on the dipstick are harmful to the engine. If the oil level is above the operating range (i.e., the engine has so much oil that the oil level gets above the cross-hatched area that shows the proper operating range), the engine could be damaged. Drain

## Caution (Continued)

the excess oil or limit driving of the vehicle, and seek a service professional to remove the excess oil.

See Engine Compartment Overview 3 346 for the location of the engine oil fill cap.

Add enough oil to put the level somewhere in the proper operating range. Push the dipstick all the way back in when through.

## Selecting the Right Engine Oil (6.2L L87 Engine)

Selecting the right engine oil depends on both the proper oil specification and viscosity grade. See Recommended Fluids and Lubricants 3 431 .

## Specification

Use full synthetic engine oils that meet the dexos1 specification. Engine oils that have been approved by GM as meeting the dexos1 specification are marked with the dexos1 approved logo.

<!-- image -->

## Caution

Failure to use the recommended engine oil or equivalent can result in engine damage not covered by the vehicle warranty.

## Viscosity Grade

Use SAE 0W-20 viscosity grade engine oil for the 6.2L L87 Engine.

When selecting an oil of the appropriate viscosity grade, it is recommended to select an oil of the correct specification. See 'Specification' earlier in this section.

## Selecting the Right Engine Oil (6.2L LT4 Supercharged Engine)

Selecting the right engine oil depends on both the proper oil specification and viscosity grade. See Recommended Fluids and Lubricants 3 431 .

## Specification

Use full synthetic engine oils that meet the dexosR specification. Engine oils that have been approved by GM as meeting the dexosR specification are marked with the dexosR approved logo.

<!-- image -->

## Caution

Failure to use the recommended engine oil or equivalent can result in engine damage not covered by the vehicle warranty.

## Viscosity Grade

Use Mobil1 ESP Formula dexosR SAE 0W-40 viscosity grade engine oil for the 6.2L LT4 Supercharged Engine.

When selecting an oil of the appropriate viscosity grade, it is recommended to select an oil of the correct specification. See 'Specification' earlier in this section.

## Engine Oil Additives/Engine Oil Flushes

Do not add anything to the oil. The recommended oils meeting the dexos specification are all that is needed for good performance and engine protection.

Engine oil system flushes are not recommended and could cause engine damage not covered by the vehicle warranty.

## What to Do with Used Oil

Used engine oil contains certain elements that can be unhealthy for your skin and could even cause cancer. Do not let used oil stay on your skin for very long. Clean your skin and nails with soap and water, or a good hand cleaner. Wash or properly dispose of clothing or rags containing used engine oil. See the manufacturer's warnings about the use and disposal of oil products.

Used oil can be a threat to the environment. If you change your own oil, be sure to drain all the oil from the filter before disposal. Never dispose of oil by putting it in the trash or pouring it on the ground, into sewers, or into streams or bodies of water. Recycle it by taking it to a place that collects used oil.

## Engine Oil Life System

## When to Change Engine Oil

This vehicle has a computer system that indicates when to change the engine oil and filter. This is based on a combination of factors which include engine revolutions, engine temperature, and miles driven. Based on driving conditions, the mileage at which an oil change is indicated can vary considerably. For the oil life system to work properly, the system must be reset every time the oil is changed.

When the system has calculated that oil life has been diminished, it indicates that an oil change is necessary. A CHANGE ENGINE OIL SOON message comes on. Change the oil as soon as possible within the next 1 000 km (600 mi). It is possible that, if driving under the best conditions, the oil life system might indicate that an oil change is not necessary for up to a year. The engine oil and filter must be changed at least once a year and at this time the system must be reset. Your dealer has trained service people who will perform this work and reset the system. It is also important to check the oil regularly over the course of an oil drain interval and keep it at the proper level.

If the system is ever reset accidentally, the oil must be changed at 5 000 km (3,000 mi) since the last oil change. Remember to reset the oil life system whenever the oil is changed.

## How to Reset the Engine Oil Life System

Reset the system whenever the engine oil is changed so that the system can calculate the next engine oil change. To reset the system:

- 1. Using the vehicle information screen controls on the right side of the instrument cluster, display OIL LIFE on the screen. See Vehicle Information 3 128 . When remaining oil life is low, the CHANGE ENGINE OIL SOON message will appear on the display.
- 2. Touch RESET on the screen to clear the CHANGE ENGINE OIL SOON message and reset the oil life at 100%.
- Be careful not to reset the oil life display accidentally at any time other than after the oil is changed. It cannot be reset accurately until the next oil change.

The oil life system can also be reset as follows:

- 1. Display OIL LIFE on the vehicle information screen. See Vehicle Information 3 128 .
- 2. Fully press and release the accelerator pedal three times within five seconds. If the CHANGE ENGINE OIL SOON message is not on, the system is reset.

The system is reset when the CHANGE ENGINE OIL SOON message is off.

If the CHANGE ENGINE OIL SOON message comes back on when the vehicle is started, the engine oil life system has not been reset. Repeat the procedure.

## Automatic Transmission Fluid

## When to Check and Change Automatic Transmission Fluid

If the vehicle has a diesel engine, see the Duramax diesel supplement.

It is usually not necessary to check the transmission fluid level. The only reason for fluid loss is a transmission leak or overheated transmission. This vehicle is not equipped with a transmission fluid level dipstick. There is a special procedure for checking and changing the transmission fluid in these vehicles. Because this procedure is difficult, this should be done at the dealer. Contact the dealer for

additional information or the procedure can be found in the service manual. See Publication Ordering Information 3 448 .

## Caution

Use of the incorrect automatic transmission fluid may damage the vehicle, and the damage may not be covered by the vehicle warranty. Always use the correct automatic transmission fluid. See Recommended Fluids and Lubricants 3 431 .

Change the fluid and filter at the scheduled maintenance intervals listed in Maintenance Schedule 3 426 . Be sure to use the transmission fluid listed in Recommended Fluids and Lubricants 3 431 .

## Engine Air Filter Life System

If equipped, this feature provides the engine air filter's remaining life and best timing for a change. The timing to change an engine air filter depends on driving and environmental conditions.

## When to Change the Engine Air Filter

When the Driver Information Center (DIC) displays a message to replace the engine air filter at the next oil change, follow this timing.

When the DIC displays a message to replace the engine air filter soon, replace the engine air filter at the earliest convenience.

The system must be reset after the engine air filter is changed.

## Cooling System

If the vehicle has the Duramax diesel engine, see the Duramax diesel supplement.

The cooling system allows the engine to maintain the correct working temperature.

<!-- image -->

- 1. Engine Electric Cooling Fans (Out of View)
- 2. Coolant Surge Tank and Pressure Cap

<!-- image -->

## Warning

An underhood electric fan can start up even when the engine is not running and can cause injury. Keep hands, clothing, and tools away from any underhood electric fan.

<!-- image -->

## Warning

Do not touch heater, radiator, a/c pipes or hoses, or other engine parts. They can be very hot and can burn you. Do not run the engine if there is a leak; all coolant could leak out. That could cause an engine fire and can burn you. Fix any leak before driving the vehicle.

## Engine Coolant

The cooling system in the vehicle is filled with DEX-COOL engine coolant. This coolant is designed to remain in the vehicle for 5 years or 240 000 km (150,000 mi), whichever occurs first.

The following explains the cooling system and how to check and add coolant when it is low. If there is a problem with engine overheating, see Engine Overheating 3 357 .

## What to Use

<!-- image -->

## Warning

Plain water, or other liquids such as alcohol, can boil before the proper coolant mixture will. With plain water or the wrong mixture, the engine could get too hot but there would not be an overheat warning. The engine could catch fire and you or others could be burned.

Use a 50/50 mixture of clean, drinkable water and DEX-COOL coolant. This mixture:

- · Gives boiling protection up to 129 °C (265 °F), engine temperature.
- · Gives freezing protection down to -37 °C (-34 °F), outside temperature.
- · Protects against rust and corrosion.
- · Helps keep the proper engine temperature.
- · Will not damage aluminum parts.

## Caution

Do not use anything other than a mix of DEX-COOL coolant that meets GM Standard GMW3420 and clean, drinkable water. Anything else can cause damage to the engine cooling system and the vehicle, which would not be covered by the vehicle warranty.

Never dispose of engine coolant by putting it in the trash, or by pouring it on the ground, or into sewers, streams, or bodies of water. Have the coolant changed by an authorized service center, familiar with legal requirements regarding used coolant disposal. This will help protect the environment and your health.

## Checking Coolant

The coolant surge tank is in the engine compartment on the driver side of the vehicle. See Engine Compartment Overview 3 346 .

The vehicle must be on a level surface when checking the coolant level.

<!-- image -->

Check to see if coolant is visible in the coolant surge tank. If the coolant inside the coolant surge tank is boiling, wait until it cools down. The coolant level should be at or above the indicated mark. If it is not, there may be a leak in the cooling system.

If coolant is visible but the coolant level is not at or above the indicated mark, see the following sections on how to add coolant to the coolant surge tank following.

## How to Add Coolant to the Coolant Surge Tank

If the vehicle has a diesel engine, see 'Cooling System' in the Duramax diesel supplement for the proper coolant fill procedure.

<!-- image -->

## Warning

Spilling coolant on hot engine parts can burn you. Coolant contains ethylene glycol and it will burn if the engine parts are hot enough.

<!-- image -->

## Warning

Plain water, or other liquids such as alcohol, can boil before the proper coolant mixture will. With plain water or the wrong mixture, the engine could get too hot but there would not be an overheat warning. The engine could catch fire and you or others could be burned.

<!-- image -->

## Warning

Steam and scalding liquids from a hot cooling system are under pressure. Turning the pressure cap, even a little, can cause them to come out at high speed and you could be burned. Never turn the cap when the cooling system, including the pressure cap, is hot. Wait for the cooling system and pressure cap to cool.

## Caution

Failure to follow the specific coolant fill procedure could cause the engine to overheat and could cause system damage. If coolant is not visible in the surge tank, contact your dealer.

If no coolant is visible in the surge tank, add coolant.

<!-- image -->

- 1. Remove the coolant surge tank pressure cap when the cooling system, including the coolant surge tank pressure cap and upper radiator hose, is no longer hot.
- Turn the pressure cap slowly counterclockwise about one full turn. If a hiss is heard, wait for that to stop. A hiss means there is still some pressure left.
- 2. Keep turning the pressure cap slowly, and remove it.
- 3. Fill the coolant surge tank with the proper mixture to the full cold mark.
- 4. With the coolant surge tank pressure cap off, start the engine and let it run until the engine coolant temperature gauge indicates approximately 90 °C (195 °F).
- By this time, the coolant level inside the coolant surge tank may be lower. If the level is lower, add more of the proper mixture to the coolant surge tank until the level reaches the indicated mark.
- 5. Replace the pressure cap tightly.
- 6. Verify coolant level after the engine is shut off and the coolant is cold. If necessary, repeat coolant fill procedure Steps 1-6.

## Caution

If the pressure cap is not tightly installed, coolant loss and engine damage may occur. Be sure the cap is properly and tightly secured.

## Engine Overheating

If the vehicle has a diesel engine, see the Duramax diesel supplement.

## Caution

Do not run the engine if there is a leak in the engine cooling system. This can cause a loss of all coolant and can damage the system and vehicle. Have any leaks fixed right away.

The vehicle has several indicators to warn of engine overheating.

There is a coolant temperature gauge and an engine coolant temperature warning light in the vehicle's instrument cluster. See Engine Coolant Temperature Gauge 3 111 and Engine Coolant Temperature Warning Light 3 121 .

In addition, there are ENGINE OVERHEATED STOP ENGINE, ENGINE OVERHEATED IDLE ENGINE, and ENGINE POWER IS REDUCED messages in the Driver Information Center (DIC).

If the decision is made not to lift the hood when this warning appears, get service help right away. See Roadside Assistance Program 3 443 .

If the decision is made to lift the hood, make sure the vehicle is parked on a level surface.

Check to see if the engine cooling fan(s) are running. If the engine is overheating, the fans should be running. If they are not, do not continue to run the engine. Have the vehicle serviced.

## If Steam is Coming from the Engine Compartment

<!-- image -->

## Warning

Steam and scalding liquids from a hot cooling system are under pressure. Turning the pressure cap, even a little, can cause them to come out at high speed and you could be burned. Never turn the cap when the cooling system, including the pressure cap, is hot. Wait for the cooling system and pressure cap to cool.

## If No Steam is Coming from the Engine Compartment

The ENGINE OVERHEATED STOP ENGINE or the ENGINE OVERHEATED IDLE ENGINE message, along with a low coolant condition, can indicate a serious problem.

If there is an engine overheat warning, but no steam is seen or heard, the problem may not be too serious. Sometimes the engine can get a little too hot when the vehicle:

- · Stops after high-speed driving.
- · Climbs a long hill on a hot day.
- · Idles for long periods in traffic.
- · Tows a trailer; see Trailer Towing 3 315 .

If the ENGINE OVERHEATED STOP ENGINE or the ENGINE OVERHEATED IDLE ENGINE message appears with no sign of steam, try this for a minute or so:

- 1. Turn the air conditioning off.
- 2. Turn the heater on to the highest temperature and to the highest fan speed. Open the windows as necessary.
- 3. When it is safe to do so, pull off the road, shift to P (Park) or N (Neutral), and let the engine idle.

If the engine coolant temperature gauge is no longer in the overheat zone or an overheat warning no longer displays, the vehicle can be driven. Continue to drive the vehicle slowly for about 10 minutes. Keep a safe vehicle distance from the vehicle in front. If the warning does

not come back on, continue to drive normally and have the cooling system checked for proper fill and function.

If the warning continues, pull over, stop, and park the vehicle right away.

If there is still no sign of steam and the vehicle is equipped with an engine driven cooling fan, push down the accelerator until the engine speed is about twice as fast as normal idle speed for at least five minutes while the vehicle is parked. If the warning is still there, turn off the engine and get everyone out of the vehicle until it cools down.

If there is no sign of steam, idle the engine for five minutes while parked. If the warning is still displayed, turn off the engine until it cools down.

## Engine Fan

If the vehicle has a diesel engine, see the Duramax diesel supplement.

If the vehicle has electric cooling fans, the fans may be heard spinning at low speed during most everyday driving. The fans may turn off if no cooling is required. Under heavy vehicle loading, trailer towing, high outside temperatures, or operation of the air

conditioning system, the fans may change to high speed and an increase in fan noise may be heard. This is normal and indicates that the cooling system is functioning properly. The fans will change to low speed when additional cooling is no longer required.

The electric engine cooling fans may run after the engine has been turned. off. This is normal and no service is required.

## Washer Fluid

## What to Use

When windshield washer fluid needs to be added, be sure to read the manufacturer's instructions before use. Use a fluid that has sufficient protection against freezing in an area where the temperature may fall below freezing.

## Adding Washer Fluid

The vehicle has a low washer fluid message on the DIC that comes on when the washer fluid is low. The message is displayed for 15 seconds at the start of each ignition cycle. When the WASHER FLUID LOW ADD FLUID message displays, washer fluid will need to be added to the windshield washer fluid reservoir.

<!-- image -->

Open the cap with the washer symbol on it. Add washer fluid until the tank is full. See Engine Compartment Overview 3 346 for reservoir location.

## Caution

- · Do not use washer fluid that contains any type of water repellent coating. This can cause the wiper blades to chatter or skip.
- · Do not mix water with ready-to-use washer fluid. Water can cause the solution to freeze and damage the washer fluid tank and other parts of the washer system.
- · Do not use engine coolant (antifreeze) in the windshield washer. It can damage the windshield washer system and paint.

(Continued)

## Caution (Continued)

- · When using concentrated washer fluid, follow the manufacturer instructions for adding water.
- · Fill the washer fluid tank only threequarters full when it is very cold. This allows for fluid expansion if freezing occurs, which could damage the tank if it is completely full.

## Brakes

Disc brake linings have built-in wear indicators that make a high-pitched warning sound when the brake linings are worn and new linings are needed. The sound can come and go or can be heard all the time when the vehicle is moving, except when applying the brake pedal firmly.

<!-- image -->

## Warning

The brake wear warning sound means that soon the brakes will not work well. That could lead to a crash. When the brake wear warning sound is heard, have the vehicle serviced.

## Caution

Continuing to drive with worn-out brake linings could result in costly brake repairs.

Some driving conditions or climates can cause a brake squeal when the brakes are first applied, clearing up following several applications. This does not mean something is wrong with the brakes.

Properly torqued wheel nuts are necessary to help prevent brake pulsation. When tires are rotated, inspect brake linings for wear and evenly tighten wheel nuts in the proper sequence to torque specifications. See Capacities and Specifications 3 436 .

Brake pads should be replaced as complete axle sets.

## Brake Pedal Travel

See your dealer if the brake pedal does not return to normal height, or if there is a rapid increase in pedal travel. This could be a sign that brake service may be required.

## Replacing Brake System Parts

Always replace brake system parts with new, approved replacement parts. If this is not done, the brakes may not work properly. The braking performance can change in many ways if the wrong brake parts are installed or if parts are improperly installed.

## Brake Pad Life System

## When to Change Brake Pads

This vehicle has a system that estimates the remaining life of the front and rear brake pads. Brake pad life is displayed in the Driver Information Center (DIC), along with a percentage for each axle. The system must be reset every time the brake pads are changed.

When the system has determined that the brake pads need to be replaced, a message will display, which may include mileage remaining.

Brake pads should always be replaced as complete axle sets.

## How to Reset the Brake Pad Life System

The system will automatically detect when significantly worn brake pads are replaced. When the ignition is turned on after new pads

and wear sensors are installed, a message will display. Follow the prompts to reset the system.

The brake pad life system can also be manually reset:

- 1. Display Brake Pad Life on the DIC. See Driver Information Center (DIC) 3 126 .
- 2. Select the Brake Pad Life menu.
- 3. Select front or rear pads as appropriate.
- 4. Select YES on the confirmation message. Repeat for pads on the other axle if they were also replaced.

## How to Disable the Brake Pad Life System

The brake pad life system can be turned off. This may be necessary if aftermarket brake pads without wear sensors are installed. When the system is turned off, the front and rear brake pad life percentages will not display. However, the built-in wear indicators that make a highpitched warning sound when the brake pads are worn can still determine when the pads should be replaced. See Brakes 3 359 .

To turn off the brake pad life system:

- 1. Display Brake Pad Life on the DIC. See Driver Information Center (DIC) 3 126 .
- 2. Select the Brake Pad Life menu.
- 3. Select DISABLE.

To turn the brake pad life system back on, follow the above steps but select ENABLE in Step 2.

## Brake Fluid

<!-- image -->

The brake master cylinder reservoir is filled with GM approved DOT 4 brake fluid as indicated on the reservoir cap. See Engine Compartment Overview 3 346 for the location of the reservoir.

## Checking Brake Fluid

With the vehicle in P (Park) on a level surface, the brake fluid level should be between the minimum and maximum marks on the brake fluid reservoir.

There are only two reasons why the brake fluid level in the reservoir may go down:

- · A fluid leak in the brake hydraulic system. Have the brake hydraulic system fixed. With a leak, the brakes will not work well.
- · Normal brake lining wear. When new linings are installed, the fluid level goes back up.

Always clean the brake fluid reservoir cap and the area around the cap before removing it.

Do not top off the brake fluid. Adding fluid does not correct a leak. If fluid is added when the linings are worn, there will be too much fluid when new brake linings are installed. Add or remove fluid, as necessary, only when work is done on the brake hydraulic system.

<!-- image -->

## Warning

If too much brake fluid is added, it can spill on the engine and burn, if the engine is hot enough. You or others could be burned, and the vehicle could be damaged. Add brake fluid only when work is done on the brake hydraulic system.

When the brake fluid falls to a low level, the brake warning light comes on. See Brake System Warning Light 3 117 .

Brake fluid absorbs water over time which degrades the effectiveness of the brake fluid. Replace brake fluid at the specified intervals to prevent increased stopping distance. See Maintenance Schedule 3 426 .

## What to Add

Use only GM approved DOT 4 brake fluid from a clean, sealed container. See Recommended Fluids and Lubricants 3 431 .

<!-- image -->

## Warning

The wrong or contaminated brake fluid could result in damage to the brake system. This could result in the loss of braking leading to a possible injury. Always use the proper GM approved brake fluid.

## Caution

If brake fluid is spilled on the vehicle's painted surfaces, the paint finish can be damaged. Immediately wash off any painted surface.

## Battery - North America

The original equipment battery is maintenance free. Do not remove the cap and do not add fluid.

Refer to the replacement number shown on the original battery label when a new battery is needed. See Engine Compartment Overview 3 346 for battery location.

The vehicle has an Absorbent Glass Mat (AGM) 12-volt battery. Installation of a standard 12volt battery will result in reduced 12-volt battery life.

When using a 12-volt battery charger on the 12volt AGM battery, some chargers have an AGM battery setting on the charger. If available, use the AGM setting on the charger, to limit charge voltage to 14.8 volts. Follow the charger manufacturer's instructions.

## Stop/Start System

This vehicle has a Stop/Start system to shut off the engine to help conserve fuel. See Stop/Start System 3 225 .

The replacement windshield must be installed according to GM specifications for proper alignment. If it is not, these systems may not work properly, they may display messages, or they may not work at all. See your dealer for proper windshield replacement.

## Acoustic Windshield

The vehicle is equipped with an acoustic windshield. If the windshield needs to be replaced be sure to get an acoustic windshield so you will continue to have the benefits an acoustic windshield can provide.

## Gas Strut(s)

Your vehicle may be equipped with gas strut(s) to provide assistance in lifting and holding open the hood/trunk/liftgate system in full open position.

<!-- image -->

## Warning

If the gas struts that hold open the hood, trunk, and/or liftgate fail, you or others could be seriously injured. Take the vehicle to your dealer for service immediately. Visually inspect the gas struts for signs of wear, cracks, or other damage periodically. Check to make sure the hood/trunk/liftgate is held open with enough force. If struts are failing to hold the hood/trunk/liftgate, do not operate. Have the vehicle serviced.

## Caution

Do not apply tape or hang any objects from gas struts. Also do not push down or pull on gas struts. This may cause damage to the vehicle.

## Headlamp Aiming

## Front Headlamp Aiming

Headlamp aim has been preset and should need no further adjustment.

If the vehicle is damaged in a crash, the headlamp aim may be affected. If adjustment to the headlamps is necessary, see your dealer.

## Bulb Replacement

For the proper type of replacement bulbs, or any bulb changing procedure not listed in this section, contact your dealer.

## Caution

Do not replace incandescent bulbs with aftermarket LED replacement bulbs. This can cause damage to the vehicle electrical system.

## LED Lighting

This vehicle has LED lamps.

For replacement of any LED lighting assembly, contact your dealer.

## Electrical System

## Electrical System Overload

The vehicle has fuses and circuit breakers to protect against an electrical system overload.

When the current electrical load is too heavy, the circuit breaker opens and closes, protecting the circuit until the current load returns to normal or the problem is fixed. This greatly reduces the chance of circuit overload and fire caused by electrical problems.

Fuses and circuit breakers protect the wires that provide the power to the devices in your vehicle.

If there is a problem on the road and a fuse needs to be replaced, the same amperage fuse can be borrowed. Choose some feature of the vehicle that is not needed to use and replace it as soon as possible.

To check a fuse, look at the band inside the fuse. If the band is broken or melted, replace the fuse. Be sure to replace a bad fuse with a fuse of the identical size and rating.

## Replacing a Blown Fuse

- 1. Turn off the vehicle.
- 2. Locate the fuse puller on the instrument panel end cap. See the Instrument Panel Fuse Block 3 372 .

<!-- image -->

- 3. Use the fuse puller to remove the fuse from the top or side, as shown above.
- 4. If the fuse must be replaced immediately, spare fuses are also provided on the instrument panel end cap or borrow a replacement fuse with the same amperage from the fuse block. Choose a vehicle feature that is not needed to safely operate the vehicle. Repeat Steps 2-3.
- 5. Insert the replacement fuse into the empty slot of the blown fuse.

At the next opportunity, see your dealer to replace the blown fuse.

## Headlamp Wiring

An electrical overload may cause the lamps to go on and off, or in some cases to remain off. Have the headlamp wiring checked right away if the lamps go on and off or remain off.

## Windshield Wipers

If the wiper motor overheats due to heavy snow or ice, the windshield wipers will stop until the motor cools and will then restart.

Although the circuit is protected from electrical overload, overload due to heavy snow or ice may cause wiper linkage damage. Always clear ice and heavy snow from the windshield before using the windshield wipers.

If the overload is caused by an electrical problem and not snow or ice, be sure to get it fixed.

## Fuses and Circuit Breakers

The wiring circuits in the vehicle are protected from short circuits by a combination of fuses and circuit breakers. This greatly reduces the chance of damage caused by electrical problems.

## Danger

Fuses and circuit breakers are marked with their ampere rating. Do not exceed the specified amperage rating when replacing fuses and circuit breakers. Use of an oversized fuse or circuit breaker can result in a vehicle fire. You and others could be seriously injured or killed.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## Warning

Installation or use of fuses that do not meet GM's original fuse specifications is dangerous. The fuses could fail, and result in a fire. You or others could be injured or killed, and the vehicle could be damaged.

See Accessories and Modifications 3 343 and General Information 3 343 .

To check or replace a blown fuse, see Electrical System Overload 3 366 .

## Engine Compartment Fuse Block

If the vehicle has a diesel engine, see the Duramax diesel supplement.

The engine compartment fuse block is in the engine compartment, on the driver side of the vehicle.

The vehicle may not be equipped with all of the fuses, relays, and features shown.

<!-- image -->

Lift the cover to access the fuse block.

## Caution

Spilling liquid on any electrical component on the vehicle may damage it. Always keep the covers on any electrical component.

## A fuse puller is available in the left instrument panel fuse block.

## Wheels and Tires

## Tires

Every new GM vehicle has high-quality tires made by a leading tire manufacturer. See the warranty manual for information regarding the tire warranty and where to get service. For additional information refer to the tire manufacturer.

<!-- image -->

## Warning

- · Poorly maintained and improperly used tires are dangerous.
- · Underinflated tires pose the same danger as overloaded tires. The resulting crash could cause serious injury. Check all tires frequently to maintain the recommended pressure. Tire pressure should be checked when the tires are cold.
- · Overloading the tires can cause overheating as a result of too much flexing. There could be a blowout and a serious crash. See Vehicle Load Limits 3 218 .
- · Overinflated tires are more likely to be cut, punctured, or broken by a sudden impact - such as when hitting a pothole. Keep tires at the recommended pressure.

(Continued)

## Warning (Continued)

- · Worn or old tires can cause a crash. If the tread is badly worn, replace them.
- · Improperly repaired tires can cause a crash. Only your dealer or an authorized tire service center should repair, replace, dismount, and mount the tires.
- · Replace any tires that have been damaged by impacts with potholes, curbs, etc.
- · Do not spin the tires in excess of 56 km/h (35 mph) on slippery surfaces such as snow, mud, ice, etc. Excessive spinning may cause the tires to explode.

See Tire Pressure for High-Speed Operation 3 384 for inflation pressure adjustment for high-speed driving.

## All-Season Tires

This vehicle may come with all-season tires. These tires are designed to provide good overall performance on most road surfaces and weather conditions. Original equipment tires designed to GM's specific tire performance criteria have a TPC specification code molded onto the sidewall.

Consider installing winter tires on the vehicle if frequent driving on snow or ice-covered roads is expected. All-season tires provide adequate performance for most winter driving conditions, but they may not offer the same level of traction or performance as winter tires on snow or ice-covered roads. See Winter Tires 3 378 .

## Winter Tires

This vehicle was not originally equipped with winter tires. Winter tires are designed for increased traction on snow and ice-covered roads. Consider installing winter tires on the vehicle if frequent driving on ice or snow covered roads is expected. See your dealer for details regarding winter tire availability and proper tire selection. Also, see Buying New Tires 3 392 .

With winter tires, there may be decreased dry road traction, increased road noise, and shorter tread life. After changing to winter tires, be alert for changes in vehicle handling and braking.

If using winter tires:

- · Use only radial ply tires of the same size, load range, and speed rating as the original equipment tires.
- · Use tires of the same brand and tread type on all four wheel positions.

Winter tires with the same speed rating as the original equipment tires may not be available for H, V, W, Y, and ZR speed rated tires. If winter tires with a lower speed rating are chosen, never exceed the tire's maximum speed capability.

## Low-Profile Tires

If the vehicle has 275/50R22 size tires, they are classified as low-profile tires.

## Caution

Low-profile tires are more susceptible to damage from road hazards or curb impact than standard profile tires. Tire and/or wheel assembly damage can occur when coming into contact with road hazards like potholes, or sharp edged objects, or when sliding into a curb. The warranty does not cover this type of damage. Keep tires set to the correct inflation pressure and when possible, avoid contact with curbs, potholes, and other road hazards.

## Tire Sidewall Labeling

Useful information about a tire is molded into the sidewall. The example shows a typical passenger vehicle tire sidewall.

Passenger/Spare Tire

<!-- image -->

(1) Tire Size : The tire size is a combination of letters and numbers used to define a particular tire's width, height, aspect ratio, construction type, and service description. See the "Tire Size" illustration in this section.

(2) TPC Spec (Tire Performance Criteria Specification) : Original equipment tires designed to GM's specific tire performance criteria have a TPC specification code molded onto the sidewall. GM's TPC specifications meet or exceed all federal safety guidelines.

- (3) DOT (Department of Transportation) : The Department of Transportation (DOT) code indicates that the tire is in compliance with the U.S. Department of Transportation Motor Vehicle Safety Standards.

DOT Tire Date of Manufacture : The last four digits of the Tire Identification Number indicate the tire manufactured date. The first two digits represent the week and the last two digits, the year. For example, the third week of the year 2020 would have a 4-digit DOT date of 0320. Week 01 is the first full week (Sunday through Saturday) of each year.

- (4) Tire Identification Number (TIN) : The letters and numbers following the DOT code are the TIN. The TIN shows the manufacturer and plant code, tire size, and date the tire was manufactured. The TIN is molded onto both sides of the tire, although only one side may have the date of manufacture.
- (5) Tire Ply Material : The type of cord and number of plies in the sidewall and under the tread.
- (6) Uniform Tire Quality Grading (UTQG) : Tire manufacturers are required to grade tires based on three performance factors: tread wear, traction, and temperature resistance. For more information, see Uniform Tire Quality Grading 3 393 .
- (7) Maximum Cold Inflation Load Limit : Maximum load that can be carried and the maximum pressure needed to support that load. For information on recommended tire pressure see Tire Pressure 3 382 and Vehicle Load Limits 3 218 .
- (8) Temporary Use Only : Only use a temporary spare tire until the road tire is repaired and replaced.  This spare tire should not be driven on over 112 km/h (70 mph), or 88 km/h (55 mph) when pulling a trailer, with the proper inflation pressure. See Full-Size Spare Tire 3 408 .

## Tire Designations

## Tire Size

The example shows a typical passenger vehicle tire size.

Passenger (P-Metric) Tire

<!-- image -->

- (1) Passenger (P-Metric) Tire : The United States version of a metric tire sizing system. The letter "P" as the first character in the tire size means a passenger vehicle tire engineered to standards set by the U.S. Tire and Rim Association.
- (2) Tire Width : The 3-digit number indicates the tire section width in millimeters from sidewall to sidewall.
- (3) Aspect Ratio : A 2-digit number that indicates the tire height-to-width measurements. For example, if the tire size aspect ratio is 75, as shown in item (3) of the illustration, it would mean that the tire's sidewall is 75 percent as high as it is wide.

(4) Construction Code : A letter code is used to indicate the type of ply construction in the tire. The letter "R" means radial ply construction; the letter "D" means diagonal or bias ply construction.

(5) Rim Diameter : Diameter of the wheel in inches.

(6) Service Description : These characters represent the load index and speed rating of the tire. The load index represents the load carrying capacity a tire is certified to carry. The speed rating is the maximum speed a tire is certified to carry a load.

## Tire Terminology and Definitions

Air Pressure : The amount of air inside the tire pressing outward on each square inch of the tire. Air pressure is expressed in kPa (kilopascal) or psi (pounds per square inch).

Aspect Ratio : The relationship of a tire's height to its width.

Belt : A rubber coated layer of cords that is located between the plies and the tread. Cords may be made from steel or other reinforcing materials.

Traction : The friction between the tire and the road surface. The amount of grip provided.

Tread : The portion of a tire that comes into contact with the road.

Treadwear Indicators : Narrow bands, sometimes called wear bars, that show across the tread of a tire when only 1.6 mm (1/16 in) of tread remains. See When It Is Time for New Tires 3 391 .

UTQGS (Uniform Tire Quality Grading Standards) : A tire information system that provides consumers with ratings for a tire's traction, temperature, and

treadwear. Ratings are determined by tire manufacturers using government testing procedures. The ratings are molded into the sidewall of the tire. See Uniform Tire Quality Grading 3 393 .

Vehicle Capacity Weight : The number of designated seating positions multiplied by 68 kg (150 lbs) plus the rated cargo load. See Vehicle Load Limits 3 218 .

Vehicle Maximum Load on the Tire : Load on an individual tire due to curb weight, accessory weight, occupant weight, and cargo weight.

Vehicle Placard : A label permanently attached to a vehicle showing the vehicle's capacity weight and the original equipment tire size and recommended inflation pressure. See 'Tire and Loading Information Label' under Vehicle Load Limits 3 218 .

## Tire Pressure

Tires need the correct amount of air pressure to operate effectively.

<!-- image -->

## Warning

Neither tire underinflation nor overinflation is good. Underinflated tires, or tires that do not have enough air, can result in:

- · Premature or irregular wear
- · Tire overloading and overheating, which could lead to a blowout
- · Poor handling
- · Reduced range for electric vehicles
- · Reduced fuel economy for internal combustion engine vehicles

Overinflated tires, or tires that have too much air, can result in:

- · Poor handling
- · Unusual wear
- · Rough ride
- · Needless damage from road hazards

The Tire and Loading Information label on the vehicle indicates the original equipment tires and the correct cold tire inflation pressures. The recommended pressure is the minimum air pressure needed to support the vehicle's maximum load carrying capacity.

For additional information regarding how much weight the vehicle can carry, and an example of the Tire and Loading Information label, see Vehicle Load Limits 3 218 . How the vehicle is loaded affects vehicle handling and ride comfort. Never load the vehicle with more weight than it was designed to carry.

## When to Check

Check the pressure of the tires once a month or more.

Do not forget the spare, if the vehicle has one. See Full-Size Spare Tire 3 408 for additional information.

## How to Check

Use a good quality pocket-type gauge to check tire pressure. Proper tire inflation cannot be determined by looking at the tire. Check the tire inflation pressure when the tires are cold, meaning the vehicle has not been driven for at least three hours or no more than 1.6 km (1 mi).

Remove the valve cap from the tire valve stem. Press the tire gauge firmly onto the valve to get a pressure measurement. If the cold tire inflation pressure matches the recommended pressure on the Tire and Loading Information label, no further adjustment is necessary. If the inflation pressure is low, add air until the recommended pressure is reached. If the inflation pressure is high, press on the metal stem in the center of the tire valve to release air.

Re-check the tire pressure with the tire gauge.

Put the valve caps back on the valve stems to keep out dirt and moisture. Use only valve caps designed for the vehicle by

GM.  TPMS sensors could be damaged and would not be covered by the vehicle warranty.

## Tire Pressure for High-Speed Operation

<!-- image -->

## Warning

Driving at high speeds, 160 km/h (100 mph) or higher, puts additional strain on tires. Sustained high-speed driving causes excessive heat buildup and can cause sudden tire failure. This could cause a crash, and you or others could be killed. Some high-speed rated tires require inflation pressure adjustment for highspeed operation. When speed limits and road conditions allow the vehicle to be driven at high speeds, make sure the tires are rated for high-speed operation, are in excellent condition, and are set to the correct cold tire inflation pressure for the vehicle load.

Vehicles with tire sizes listed in the High Speed Operation Inflation Pressures table require inflation pressure adjustment when driving the vehicle at speeds of 160 km/h (100 mph) or higher. Set the cold tire inflation pressure to the corresponding value in the table for the tire size on the vehicle.

| High Speed Operation Inflation Pressures   | High Speed Operation Inflation Pressures   |
|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Tire Size                                  | Cold Inflation Pressure kPa (psi)          |
| 275/50R22 111H                             | 270 kPa (39 psi)                           |

Return the tires to the recommended cold tire inflation pressure when high-speed driving has ended. See Vehicle Load Limits 3 218 and Tire Pressure 3 382 .

## Tire Pressure Monitor System

The Tire Pressure Monitor System (TPMS) uses radio and sensor technology to check tire pressure levels. The TPMS sensors monitor the air pressure in your tires and transmit tire pressure readings to a receiver located in the vehicle.

Each tire, including the spare (if provided), should be checked monthly when cold and inflated to the inflation pressure recommended by the vehicle manufacturer on the vehicle placard or tire inflation pressure label. (If your vehicle has tires of a different size than the size indicated on the vehicle placard or tire inflation pressure label, you should determine the proper tire inflation pressure for those tires.)

As an added safety feature, your vehicle has been equipped with a tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS) that illuminates a low tire pressure telltale when one or more of your tires is significantly under-inflated.

Accordingly, when the low tire pressure telltale illuminates, you should stop and check your tires as soon as possible, and inflate them to the proper pressure. Driving on a significantly under-inflated tire causes the tire to overheat and can lead to tire failure. Under-inflation also reduces energy efficiency and tire tread life, and may affect the vehicle's handling and stopping ability.

Please note that the TPMS is not a substitute for proper tire maintenance, and it is the driver's responsibility to maintain correct tire pressure,

even if under-inflation has not reached the level to trigger illumination of the TPMS low tire pressure telltale.

Your vehicle has also been equipped with a TPMS malfunction indicator to indicate when the system is not operating properly. The TPMS malfunction indicator is combined with the low tire pressure telltale. When the system detects a malfunction, the telltale will flash for approximately one minute and then remain continuously illuminated. This sequence will continue upon subsequent vehicle start-ups as long as the malfunction exists.

When the malfunction indicator is illuminated, the system may not be able to detect or signal low tire pressure as intended. TPMS malfunctions may occur for a variety

of reasons, including the installation of replacement or alternate tires or wheels on the vehicle that prevent the TPMS from functioning properly. Always check the TPMS malfunction telltale after replacing one or more tires or wheels on your vehicle to ensure that the replacement or alternate tires and wheels allow the TPMS to continue to function properly.

See Tire Pressure Monitor Operation 3 386 .

See Radio Frequency Statement 3 448 .

## Tire Pressure Monitor Operation

This vehicle may have a Tire Pressure Monitor System (TPMS). The TPMS is designed to warn the driver when a low tire pressure condition exists. TPMS sensors are mounted onto each tire and wheel assembly, excluding the spare tire and wheel assembly. The TPMS sensors monitor the air pressure in the tires and transmit the tire pressure readings to a receiver located in the vehicle.

<!-- image -->

When a low tire pressure condition is detected, the TPMS illuminates the low tire pressure warning light located on the instrument cluster. If the warning light comes on, stop as soon as possible and inflate the tires to the recommended pressure shown on the Tire and Loading Information label. See Vehicle Load Limits 3 218 .

A message to check the pressure in a specific tire displays in the Driver Information Center (DIC). The low tire pressure warning light and the DIC warning message come on at each ignition cycle until the tires are inflated to the correct inflation pressure. If the vehicle has DIC buttons, tire pressure levels can be viewed. For additional information and details about the DIC operation and displays, see Driver Information Center (DIC) 3 126 .

The low tire pressure warning light may come on in cool weather when the vehicle is first started, and then turn off as the vehicle is

driven. This could be an early indicator that the air pressure is getting low and needs to be inflated to the proper pressure.

A Tire and Loading Information label shows the size of the original equipment tires and the correct inflation pressure for the tires when they are cold. See Vehicle Load Limits 3 218 , for an example of the Tire and Loading Information label and its location. Also see Tire Pressure 3 382 .

The TPMS can warn about a low tire pressure condition but it does not replace normal tire maintenance. See Tire Inspection 3 390 , Tire Rotation 3 390 , and Tires 3 377 .

## Caution

Tire sealant materials are not all the same. A non-approved tire sealant could damage the TPMS sensors. TPMS sensor damage caused by using an incorrect tire sealant is not covered by the vehicle warranty. Always use only the GM approved tire sealant available through your dealer or included in the vehicle.

## TPMS Malfunction Light and Message

The TPMS will not function properly if one or more of the TPMS sensors are missing or inoperable. When the system detects a malfunction, the low tire pressure warning light flashes for about one minute and then stays on for the remainder of the ignition cycle. A DIC warning message also displays. The malfunction light and DIC warning message come on at each ignition cycle until the problem is corrected. Some of the conditions that can cause these to come on are:

- · The TPMS sensor matching process was not done or not completed successfully after rotating the tires. The malfunction light and the DIC message should go off after successfully completing the sensor matching process. See "TPMS Sensor Matching Process" later in this section.
- · One of the road tires has been replaced with the spare tire. The spare tire does not have a TPMS sensor. The malfunction light and the DIC message should go off after the road tire is replaced and the sensor matching process is performed successfully. See "TPMS Sensor Matching Process" later in this section.
- · One or more TPMS sensors are missing or damaged. The malfunction light and the DIC message should go off when the TPMS sensors are installed and the sensor matching process is performed successfully. See your dealer for service.
- · Operating electronic devices or being near facilities using radio wave frequencies similar to the TPMS could cause the TPMS sensors to malfunction.
- · Replacement tires or wheels do not match the original equipment tires or wheels. Tires and wheels other than those recommended could prevent the TPMS from functioning properly. See Buying New Tires 3 392 .

If the TPMS is not functioning properly, it cannot detect or signal a low tire pressure condition. See your dealer for service if the TPMS malfunction light and DIC message come on and stay on.

## Tire Fill Alert (If Equipped)

This feature provides visual and audible alerts outside the vehicle to help when inflating an underinflated tire to the recommended cold tire pressure.

When the low tire pressure warning light comes on:

- 1. Park the vehicle in a safe, level place.
- 2. Set the parking brake firmly.
- 3. Place the vehicle in P (Park).
- 4. Add air to the tire that is underinflated. The turn signal lamp will flash.
- When the recommended pressure is reached, the horn sounds once and the turn signal lamp will stop flashing and briefly turn solid.

Repeat these steps for all underinflated tires that have illuminated the low tire pressure warning light.

<!-- image -->

## Warning

Overinflating a tire could cause the tire to rupture and you or others could be injured. Do not exceed the maximum pressure listed on the tire sidewall. See Tire Sidewall Labeling 3 379 and Vehicle Load Limits 3 218 .

If the tire is overinflated by more than 35 kPa (5 psi), the horn will sound multiple times and the turn signal lamp will continue to flash for several seconds after filling stops. To release and correct the pressure, while the turn signal lamp is still flashing, briefly press the center of the valve stem. When the recommended pressure is reached, the horn sounds once.

If the turn signal lamp does not flash within 15 seconds after starting to inflate the tire, the tire fill alert has not been activated or is not working.

If the hazard warning flashers are on, the tire fill alert visual feedback will not work properly.

The TPMS will not activate the tire fill alert

- · There is interference from an external device or transmitter.

properly under the following conditions:

- · The air pressure from the inflation device is not sufficient to inflate the tire.
- · There is a malfunction in the horn or turn signal lamps.
- · There is a malfunction in the TPMS.
- · The identification code of the TPMS sensor is not registered to the system.
- · The battery of the TPMS sensor is low.

If the tire fill alert does not operate due to TPMS interference, move the vehicle about 1 m (3 ft) back or forward and try again. If the tire fill alert feature is not working, use a tire pressure gauge.

## TPMS Sensor Matching Process - Auto Learn Function

Each TPMS sensor has a unique identification code. The identification code needs to be matched to a new tire/wheel position after rotating the tires or replacing one or more of the TPMS sensors. When a tire is installed, the vehicle must be stationary for about 20 minutes before the system recalculates. The following relearn process takes up to 10 minutes, driving at a minimum speed of 20 km/h (12 mph). A dash (-) or pressure value will display in the DIC. See Driver Information Center (DIC) 3 126 . A warning message displays in the DIC if a problem occurs during the relearn process.

## Trailer Tire Pressure Monitoring Operation

If equipped, the Trailer Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TTPMS) is designed to monitor the pressure of the trailer tires

and warn the driver when a low pressure condition exists. TTPMS sensors for four tires are provided. The system can accommodate a trailer with up to six tires if additional sensors are purchased from the dealer. Also, the system can be paired with up to five individual trailers.

Prior to use, the vehicle must learn the sensors by following the learning process. See Trailering App 3 330 .

<!-- image -->

Contact your trailer service center or tire service center to have the pressure sensors installed inside the trailer tires. The technician should insert the sensor stem through the hole in the trailer wheel. When the sensor is correctly positioned, the nut on the sensor stem should

be tightened to 8 Y (6 lb ft). When mounting the trailer tire onto the trailer wheel be careful not to damage the sensor.

The Trailering App can be used to view the tire pressures after the recommended trailer tire pressures have been entered. Refer to the trailer tire placard on the trailer or the trailer tire sidewall for the recommended tire pressure.

The system is compatible with trailer tires that have placard pressure values from 103 - 689 kpa (15 - 100 psi) and 103 - 1020 kpa (15 - 148 psi). The hole in the wheel for the tire stem must be 11.43 mm (0.453 in) in diameter. Use of the pressure sensors on a wheel with a different stem hole size could result in loss of air from the tire.

If a low trailer tire pressure condition is detected, the TTPMS displays a warning message on the DIC. If the warning message is displayed, stop as soon as possible and inflate the tires to the recommended pressure shown on the tire placard on the trailer.

In addition, the TTPMS monitors the temperature of the trailer tires. If the system detects a high temperature on one or more of the trailer tires, a warning message will be displayed on the DIC. If this warning message is displayed, stop as soon as possible, and

inspect the overheated trailer tire. Common causes for high trailer tire temperature are underinflation, overloading, or tire damage.

## TTPMS Malfunction Message

The TTPMS will not function properly if one or more of the trailer tire sensors are missing or inoperable. If the system detects a malfunction, a DIC message indicates that the system requires service. Some of the conditions that can cause the service message to occur are:

- · The TTPMS sensor learning process was not done or not completed successfully. The DIC message should go off after successfully completing the sensor learning process. See "TTPMS Sensor Learning Process" under Trailering App 3 330 .
- · One of the trailer tires has been replaced with the spare tire which does not have a learned TTPMS sensor. The DIC message should turn off after the pressure sensor is installed in the tire, and the learning process is performed successfully. See "TTPMS Sensor Learning Process" under Trailering App 3 330 .

- · One or more TTPMS sensors are missing or damaged. The DIC message should go off when the TTPMS sensors are installed and the sensor learning process is performed successfully. See "TTPMS Sensor Learning Process" under Trailering App 3 330 .
- · If the system does not receive the signal from an individual sensor, an error message may not occur until the vehicle has been driver for a period of time.
- · Operating electronic devices or being near facilities using radio wave frequencies similar to the TTPMS could cause interference to the TTPMS which could cause loss of signal reception from the sensor.

If the TTPMS is not functioning properly, it cannot detect or signal a low tire condition. See your dealer for service if the DIC message comes on and stays on when the trailer tire pressures have been checked and determined to be correct.

## Tire Inspection

We recommend that the tires, including the spare tire, if the vehicle has one, be inspected for signs of wear or damage at least once a month.

Replace the tire if:

- · There is cord or fabric showing through the tire's rubber.
- · The indicators at three or more places around the tire can be seen.
- · The tread or sidewall is cracked, cut, or snagged deep enough to show cord or fabric.
- · The tire has a puncture, cut, or other damage that cannot be repaired well because of the size or location of the damage.
- · The tire has a bump, bulge, or split.

## Tire Rotation

Tires should be rotated according to the interval listed in the maintenance schedule. See Maintenance Schedule 3 426 .

Tires are rotated to achieve a more uniform wear for all tires. The first rotation is the most important.

Anytime unusual wear is noticed, rotate the tires as soon as possible, check for proper tire inflation pressure, and check for damaged tires or wheels. If the unusual wear continues after the rotation, check the wheel alignment. See When It Is Time for New Tires 3 391 and Wheel Replacement 3 395 .

<!-- image -->

Use this rotation pattern when rotating the tires.

Do not include the spare tire in the tire rotation.

Adjust the front and rear tires to the recommended inflation pressure on the Tire and Loading Information label after the tires have been rotated. See Tire Pressure 3 382 and Vehicle Load Limits 3 218 .

Reset the Tire Pressure Monitor System. See Tire Pressure Monitor Operation 3 386 .

Check that all wheel nuts are properly tightened. See 'Wheel Nut Torque' under Capacities and Specifications 3 436 and 'Removing the Flat Tire and Installing the Spare Tire' under Tire Changing 3 397 .

<!-- image -->

## Warning

Rust or dirt on a wheel, or on the parts to which it is fastened, can cause wheel nuts to become loose over time. The wheel could come off and cause a crash. When changing a wheel, remove any rust or dirt from places where the wheel attaches to the vehicle. In an emergency, a cloth or paper towel can be used; however, use a scraper or wire brush later to remove all rust or dirt.

Lightly coat the inner diameter of the wheel hub opening with wheel bearing grease after a wheel change or tire rotation to prevent corrosion or rust build-up.

<!-- image -->

## Warning

Do not apply grease to the wheel mounting surface, wheel conical seats, or the wheel nuts or bolts. Grease applied to these areas could cause a wheel to become loose or come off, resulting in a crash.

## When It Is Time for New Tires

Factors, such as maintenance, temperatures, driving speeds, vehicle loading, and road conditions affect the wear rate of the tires.

<!-- image -->

Treadwear indicators are one way to tell when it is time for new tires. Treadwear indicators appear when the tires have only 1.6 mm (1/16 in) or less of tread remaining. See Tire Inspection 3 390 and Tire Rotation 3 390 .

The rubber in tires ages over time. This also applies to the spare tire, if the vehicle has one, even if it is never used. Multiple factors including temperatures, loading conditions, and inflation pressure maintenance affect how fast aging takes place. GM recommends that tires, including the spare if equipped, be replaced after six years, regardless of tread wear. To identify the age of a tire, use the tire manufacture date, which is the last four digits of the DOT Tire Identification Number (TIN) molded into one side of the tire sidewall. The last four digits of the TIN indicate the tire manufactured date. The first two digits represent the week and the last two digits, the year. For example, the third week of the year 2020 would have a 4-digit DOT date of 0320. Week 01 is the first full week (Sunday through Saturday) of each year.

## Vehicle Storage

Tires age when stored normally mounted on a parked vehicle. Park a vehicle that will be stored for at least a month in a cool, dry, clean area away from direct sunlight to slow aging. This area should be free of grease, gasoline, or other substances that can deteriorate rubber.

Parking for an extended period can cause flat spots on the tires that may result in vibrations while driving. When storing a vehicle for at least a month, remove the tires or raise the vehicle to reduce the weight from the tires.

## Buying New Tires

GM has developed and matched specific tires for the vehicle. The original equipment tires installed were designed to meet General Motors Tire Performance Criteria Specification (TPC Spec) system rating. When replacement tires are needed, GM strongly recommends buying tires with the same TPC Spec rating.

GM's exclusive TPC Spec system considers over a dozen critical specifications that impact the overall performance of the vehicle, including brake system

performance, ride and handling, traction control, and tire pressure monitoring performance. GM's TPC Spec number is molded onto the tire's sidewall near the tire size. If the tires have an all-season tread design, the TPC Spec number will be followed by MS for mud and snow. See Tire Sidewall Labeling 3 379 for additional information.

GM recommends replacing worn tires in complete sets of four. Uniform tread depth on all tires will help to maintain the performance of the vehicle. Braking and handling performance may be adversely affected if all the tires are not replaced at the same time. If proper rotation and maintenance have been done, all four tires should wear out at about the same time. However, if it is necessary to replace only one axle set of worn tires, place the new tires on the rear axle. See Tire Rotation 3 390 .

<!-- image -->

## Warning

Tires could explode during improper service. Attempting to mount or dismount a tire could cause injury or death. Only your dealer or authorized tire service center should mount or dismount the tires.

<!-- image -->

## Warning

Mixing tires of different sizes (other than those originally installed on the vehicle), brands, tread patterns, or types may cause loss of vehicle control, resulting in a crash or other vehicle damage. Use the correct size, brand, and type of tire on all wheels.

<!-- image -->

## Warning

Using bias-ply tires on the vehicle may cause the wheel rim flanges to develop cracks after many miles of driving.

(Continued)

## Warning (Continued)

A tire and/or wheel could fail suddenly and cause a crash. Use only radial-ply tires with the wheels on the vehicle.

Winter tires with the same speed rating as the original equipment tires may not be available for H, V, W, Y and ZR speed rated tires. Never exceed the winter tires' maximum speed capability when using winter tires with a lower speed rating.

If the vehicle tires must be replaced with a tire that does not have a TPC Spec number, make sure they are the same size, load range, speed rating, and construction (radial) as the original tires.

The Tire and Loading Information label indicates the original equipment tires on the vehicle. See Vehicle Load Limits 3 218 .

## Different Size Tires and Wheels

If wheels or tires are installed that are a different size than the original equipment wheels and tires, vehicle performance,

including its braking, ride and handling characteristics, stability, and resistance to rollover may be affected. If the vehicle has electronic systems such as antilock brakes, rollover airbags, traction control, electronic stability control, or All-Wheel Drive, the performance of these systems can also be affected.

<!-- image -->

## Warning

If different sized wheels are used, there may not be an acceptable level of performance and safety if tires not recommended for those wheels are selected. This increases the chance of a crash and serious injury. Only use GM specific wheel and tire systems developed for the vehicle, and have them properly installed by a GM certified technician.

See Buying New Tires 3 392 and Accessories and Modifications 3 343 .

## Uniform Tire Quality Grading

The following information relates to the system developed by the United States National Highway Traffic Safety

Administration (NHTSA), which grades tires by treadwear, traction, and temperature performance. This applies only to vehicles sold in the United States. The grades are molded on the sidewalls of most passenger car tires. The Uniform Tire Quality Grading (UTQG) system does not apply to deep tread, winter tires, compact spare tires, tires with nominal rim diameters of 10 to 12 inches (25 to 30 cm), or to some limited-production tires.

While the tires available on General Motors passenger cars and light trucks may vary with respect to these grades, they must also conform to federal safety requirements and additional General Motors Tire Performance Criteria (TPC) standards.

Quality grades can be found where applicable on the tire sidewall between tread shoulder and maximum section width. For example:

## Treadwear 200 Traction AA Temperature A

All Passenger Car Tires Must Conform to Federal Safety Requirements In Addition To These Grades.

## Treadwear

The treadwear grade is a comparative rating based on the wear rate of the tire when tested under controlled conditions on a specified government test course. For example, a tire graded 150 would wear one and one-half (1½) times as well on the government course as a tire graded 100. The relative performance of tires depends upon the actual conditions of their use, however, and may depart significantly from the norm due to variations in driving habits, service practices and differences in road characteristics and climate.

## Traction

The traction grades, from highest to lowest, are AA, A, B, and C. Those grades represent the tire's ability to stop on wet pavement as measured under controlled conditions on specified

government test surfaces of asphalt and concrete. A tire marked C may have poor traction performance. Warning: The traction grade assigned to this tire is based on straight-ahead braking traction tests, and does not include acceleration, cornering, hydroplaning, or peak traction characteristics.

## Temperature

The temperature grades are A (the highest), B, and C, representing the tire's resistance to the generation of heat and its ability to dissipate heat when tested under controlled conditions on a specified indoor laboratory test wheel. Sustained high temperature can cause the material of the tire to degenerate and reduce tire life, and excessive temperature can lead to sudden tire failure. The grade C corresponds to a level of performance which all passenger car tires must meet under the Federal Motor Safety Standard No. 109. Grades B and A represent higher levels of performance on the laboratory test wheel than the minimum required

by law. Warning: The temperature grade for this tire is established for a tire that is properly inflated and not overloaded. Excessive speed, underinflation, or excessive loading, either separately or in combination, can cause heat buildup and possible tire failure.

## Wheel Alignment and Tire Balance

The tires and wheels were aligned and balanced at the factory to provide the longest tire life and best overall performance. Adjustments to wheel alignment and tire balancing are not necessary on a regular basis. Consider an alignment check if there is unusual tire wear or the vehicle is significantly pulling to one side or the other. Some slight pull to the left or right, depending on the crown of the road and/or other road surface variations such as troughs or ruts, is normal. If the vehicle is vibrating when driving on a smooth road, the tires and wheels may need to be rebalanced. See your dealer for proper diagnosis.

## Wheel Replacement

Replace any wheel that is bent, cracked, or badly rusted or corroded. If wheel nuts keep coming loose, the wheel, wheel bolts, and wheel nuts should be replaced. If the wheel leaks air, replace it. Some aluminum wheels can be repaired. See your dealer if any of these conditions exist.

Your dealer will know the kind of wheel that is needed.

Each new wheel should have the same loadcarrying capacity, diameter, width, offset, and be mounted the same way as the one it replaces.

Replace wheels, wheel bolts, wheel nuts, or Tire Pressure Monitor System (TPMS) sensors with new GM original equipment parts.

<!-- image -->

## Warning

Using the wrong replacement wheels, wheel bolts, or wheel nuts can be dangerous. It could affect the braking and handling of the vehicle. Tires can lose air and cause loss of control, resulting

(Continued)

## Warning (Continued)

in a crash. Always use the correct wheel, wheel bolts, and wheel nuts for replacement.

<!-- image -->

## Warning

Replacing a wheel with a used one is dangerous. How it has been used or how far it has been driven may be unknown. It could fail suddenly and cause a crash. When replacing wheels, use a new GM original equipment wheel.

## Caution

The wrong wheel can also cause problems with bearing life, brake cooling, speedometer or odometer calibration, headlamp aim, bumper height, vehicle ground clearance, and tire or tire chain clearance to the body and chassis.

## Tire Chains

<!-- image -->

## Warning

Do not use tire chains. There is not enough clearance. Tire chains used on a vehicle without the proper amount of clearance can cause damage to the brakes, suspension, or other vehicle parts. The area damaged by the tire chains could cause loss of control and a crash.

Use another type of traction device only if its manufacturer recommends it for the vehicle's tire size combination and road conditions. Follow that manufacturer's instructions. To avoid vehicle damage, drive slowly and readjust or remove the traction device if it contacts the vehicle. Do not spin the wheels. If traction devices are used, install them on the tires of the drive axle only.

## If a Tire Goes Flat

It is unusual for a tire to blow out while driving, especially if the tires are maintained properly. It is much more likely for a tire to experience a slow leak. See Tires 3 377 .

In the event of a blowout, follow these tips:

- · A rear blowout, particularly on a curve, acts much like a skid and may require the same correction as used in a skid. Stop pressing the accelerator pedal and steer to straighten the vehicle. It may be very bumpy and noisy. Gently brake to a stop.
- · A front tire blowout causes the vehicle to pull toward the side of the flat. Take your foot off the accelerator pedal and grip the steering wheel firmly. Steer to maintain lane position, and then gently brake to a stop.

<!-- image -->

## Warning

Driving on a flat tire will cause permanent damage to the tire. Re-inflating a tire after it has been driven on while severely underinflated or flat may cause a blowout and a serious crash. Never attempt to re-inflate a tire that has been driven on while severely underinflated or flat. Have your dealer or an authorized tire service center repair or replace the flat tire as soon as possible.

<!-- image -->

## Warning

Lifting a vehicle and getting under it to do maintenance or repairs is dangerous without the appropriate safety equipment and training. If a jack is provided with the vehicle, it is designed only for changing a flat tire. If it is used for anything else, you or others could be badly injured or killed if the vehicle slips off the jack. If a jack is provided with the vehicle, only use it for changing a flat tire.

If a tire goes flat, avoid further tire and wheel damage by driving slowly to a level place, well off the road, if possible. Turn on the hazard warning flashers. See Hazard Warning Flashers 3 141 .

If your vehicle is loaded at or near maximum cargo capacity, it may be difficult to fit the jack under the vehicle due to the environment (shoulder slope, road debris, etc.). Removal of some weight may improve the ability to fit the jack under the vehicle at the correct jacking location.

<!-- image -->

## Warning

Changing a tire can be dangerous. The vehicle can slip off the jack and roll over or fall causing injury or death. Find a level place to change the tire. Do not attempt to change a tire on unlevel, off-road terrain. To help prevent the vehicle from moving:

- 1. Set the parking brake.
- 2. Shift the vehicle to P (Park).
- 3. For vehicles with four-wheel drive with an N (Neutral) transfer case position, be sure the transfer case is in a drive gear not in N (Neutral).
- 4. Turn off the engine and do not restart while the vehicle is raised.
- 5. Do not allow passengers to remain in the vehicle.
- 6. Place wheel blocks, if equipped, on both sides of the tire at the opposite corner of the tire being changed.

To safely change a flat tire:

<!-- image -->

- 1. If equipped, place wheel blocks (1), as shown, to prevent the vehicle from moving.
- 2. Use the jacking equipment to change the flat tire (2). See Tire Changing 3 397 .

## Tire Changing

Before changing a flat tire, see 'Hands-Free Operation' under Liftgate 3 19 .

## Performance Brake Package RPO J49

The original spare tire/wheel will not fit onto the front axle if equipped with the performance brake package RPO J49. If there is a flat tire on the front axle, a tire/wheel from the rear axle must be used to make the repair. The spare tire will then replace the tire/wheel that is removed from the rear axle.

If equipped with the performance brake package RPO J49, and the flat tire is on the front axle, stop after performing all steps in Removing the Spare Tire and Tools and do the following. Otherwise, continue with the procedure:

## Full-Size Spare Tire

If this vehicle came with a full-size spare tire, it was fully inflated when new, however, it can lose air over time. Check the inflation pressure regularly. See Tire Pressure 3 382 and Vehicle Load Limits 3 218 for information regarding proper tire inflation and loading the vehicle. For instructions on how to remove, install, or store a spare tire, see Tire Changing 3 397 .

After installing the spare tire on the vehicle, stop as soon as possible and check that the spare is correctly inflated. The spare tire is made to perform well at speeds up to 112 km/h (70 MPH) at the recommended inflation pressure, so you can finish your trip.

Have the damaged or flat road tire repaired or replaced and installed back onto the vehicle as soon as possible so the spare tire will be available in case it is needed again. Do not mix tires and wheels of different sizes, because they will not fit. Keep the spare tire and its wheel together.

## Caution

If the vehicle has four-wheel drive and a different size spare tire is installed, do not drive in four-wheel drive until the flat tire is repaired and/or replaced. The vehicle could be damaged and the repairs would not be covered by the warranty. Never use four-wheel drive when a different size spare tire is installed on the vehicle.

The vehicle may have a different size spare tire than the road tires originally installed on the vehicle. This spare tire was developed for use on this vehicle, so it is all right to drive

on it. If the vehicle has four-wheel drive and a different size spare tire is installed, drive only in two-wheel drive.

If the vehicle has a spare tire that does not match the original road tires and wheels in size and type, do not include the spare in the tire rotation.

If equipped with a temporary use full-size spare tire, it is indicated on the tire sidewall. See Tire Sidewall Labeling 3 379 . This spare tire should not be driven on over 112 km/h (70 mph), or 88 km/h (55 mph) when pulling a trailer, at the proper inflation pressure. Repair and replace the road tire as soon as it is convenient, and stow the spare tire for future use.

## Jump Starting

## Jump Starting - North America

If the vehicle has a diesel engine, see the Duramax diesel supplement.

For more information about the vehicle battery, see Battery - North America 3 362 .

If the vehicle battery has run down, you may want to use another vehicle and some jumper cables to start your vehicle. Be sure to use the following steps to do it safely.

<!-- image -->

## Warning

WARNING: Battery posts, terminals and related accessories can expose you to chemicals including lead and lead compounds, which are known to the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm. Wash hands after handling. For more information go to www.P65Warnings.ca.gov.

## See California Proposition 65 Warning 3 1 .

<!-- image -->

## Warning

Batteries can hurt you. They can be dangerous because:

- · They contain gas that can explode or ignite.
- · They contain acid that can burn you.
- · They contain enough electricity to burn you.

If you do not follow these steps exactly, some or all of these things can hurt you.

## Caution

Ignoring these steps could result in costly damage to the vehicle that would not be covered by the vehicle warranty. Trying to start the vehicle by pushing or pulling it will not work, and it could damage the vehicle.

## Caution

If the jumper cables are connected or removed in the wrong order, electrical shorting may occur and damage the vehicle. The repairs would not be covered by the vehicle warranty. Always connect and remove the jumper cables in the correct order, making sure that the cables do not touch each other or other metal.

<!-- image -->

## Connection Points and Sequence

- 1. Discharged Battery Positive (+) Terminal
- 2. Good Battery Positive (+) Terminal
- 3. Good Battery Negative (-) Terminal
- 4. Discharged Battery Negative (-) Grounding Point

The good battery positive (+) terminal and the good battery negative (-) terminal are on the battery of the vehicle providing the jump start.

The discharged battery positive (+) terminal and the discharged battery negative (-) grounding point are on the passenger side of the vehicle.

The discharged battery positive (+) terminal is under a cover. Open the cover to expose the terminal.

- 1. Check the other vehicle. It must have a 12-volt battery with a negative ground system.

## Caution

If the other vehicle does not have a 12volt system with a negative ground, both vehicles can be damaged. Only use a vehicle that has a 12-volt system with a negative ground for jump starting.

- 2. If you have a vehicle with a diesel engine with two batteries, you should know before you begin that, especially in cold weather, you may not be able to get enough power from a single battery in another vehicle to start your diesel engine. If your vehicle has more than one battery, using the battery that is closer to the starter will reduce electrical resistance. This is located on the passenger side, in the rear of the engine compartment.
- 3. Get the vehicles close enough so the jumper cables can reach, but be sure the vehicles are not touching each other. If they are, it could cause an unwanted ground connection. You would not be able to start your vehicle, and the bad grounding could damage the electrical systems.

To avoid the possibility of the vehicles rolling, set the parking brake firmly on both vehicles involved in the jump start procedure. Put the automatic transmission in P (Park) before setting the parking brake. If you have a four-wheel-drive vehicle, be sure the transfer case is in a drive gear, not in N (Neutral).

## Caution

If any accessories are left on or plugged in during the jump starting procedure, they could be damaged. The repairs would not be covered by the vehicle warranty. Whenever possible, turn off or unplug all accessories on either vehicle when jump starting.

- 4. Turn the ignition off on both vehicles. Unplug unnecessary accessories plugged into the accessory power outlets. Turn off
- the radio and all the lamps that are not needed. This will avoid sparks and help save both batteries. And it could save the radio!
- 5. Open the hood on the other vehicle and locate the positive (+) and negative (-) terminal locations on that vehicle.

## Warning

An electric fan can start up even when the engine is not running and can injure you. Keep hands, clothing, and tools away from any underhood electric fan.

<!-- image -->

## Warning

Using a match near a battery can cause battery gas to explode. People have been hurt doing this, and some have been blinded. Use a flashlight if you need more light.

Battery fluid contains acid that can burn you. Do not get it on you. If you accidentally get it in your eyes or on your skin, flush the place with water and get medical help immediately.

<!-- image -->

## Warning

Fans or other moving engine parts can injure you badly. Keep your hands away from moving parts once the engine is running.

- 6. Check that the jumper cables do not have loose or missing insulation. If they do, you could get a shock. The vehicles could be damaged too.
- Before you connect the cables, here are some basic things you should know. Positive (+) will go to positive (+) or to a remote positive (+) terminal if the vehicle has one. Negative (-) will go to a heavy, unpainted metal engine part or to a remote negative (-) terminal if the vehicle has one.
- Do not connect positive (+) to negative (-) the battery and maybe other parts too. And do not connect the negative (-) cable to the

or you will get a short that would damage negative (-) terminal on the dead battery because this can cause sparks.

- 7. Connect one end of the red positive (+) cable to the discharged battery positive (+) terminal.
- 8. Do not let the other end touch metal. Connect it to the good battery positive (+) terminal. Use a remote positive (+) terminal if the vehicle has one.
- 9. Connect one end of the black negative (-) cable to the good battery negative (-) terminal. Use a remote negative (-) terminal if the vehicle has one.
- Do not let the other end touch anything until the next step.
- 10. Connect the other end of the negative (-) cable to the discharged battery negative (-) grounding point.
- 11. Start the vehicle with the good battery and run the engine for a while.
- 12. Try to start the vehicle that had the dead battery. If it will not start after a few tries, it probably needs service.

## Jumper Cable Removal

Reverse the sequence exactly when removing the jumper cables.

After starting the disabled vehicle and removing the jumper cables, allow it to idle for several minutes.

- · Nozzle must be kept at least 30 cm (1 ft) away from all surfaces.

## Finish Care

Application of aftermarket clearcoat sealant/wax materials is not recommended. If painted surfaces are damaged, see your dealer to have the damage assessed and repaired. Foreign materials such as calcium chloride and other salts, ice melting agents, road oil and tar, tree sap, bird droppings, chemicals from industrial chimneys, etc., can damage the vehicle's finish if they remain on painted surfaces. Wash the vehicle as soon as possible. If necessary, use non-abrasive cleaners that are marked safe for painted surfaces to remove foreign matter.

Occasional hand waxing or mild polishing should be done to remove residue from the paint finish. See your dealer for approved cleaning products.

Do not apply waxes or polishes to uncoated plastic, vinyl, rubber, decals, simulated wood, or flat paint as damage can occur.

## Caution

Machine compounding or aggressive polishing on a basecoat/clearcoat paint finish may damage it. Use only nonabrasive waxes and polishes that are made for a basecoat/clearcoat paint finish on the vehicle.

To keep the paint finish looking new, keep the vehicle garaged or covered whenever possible.

## Protecting Exterior Bright Metal Moldings

## Caution

Failure to clean and protect the bright metal moldings can result in a hazy white finish or pitting. This damage would not be covered by the vehicle warranty.

The bright metal moldings on the vehicle are aluminum, chrome or stainless steel. To prevent damage always follow these cleaning instructions:

- · Be sure the molding is cool to the touch before applying any cleaning solution.

- · Use only approved cleaning solutions for aluminum, chrome or stainless steel. Some cleaners are highly acidic or contain alkaline substances and can damage the moldings.
- · Do not use cleaners that are not intended for automotive use.
- · Always dilute a concentrated cleaner according to the manufacturer's instructions.
- · Use a nonabrasive wax on the vehicle after washing to protect and extend the molding finish.

## Cleaning Exterior Lamps/Lenses, Emblems, Decals, and Stripes

Use only lukewarm or cold water, a soft cloth, and a car washing soap to clean exterior lamps, lenses, emblems, decals, and stripes. Follow instructions under "Washing the Vehicle" previously in this section.

Lamp covers are made of plastic, and some have a UV protective coating. Do not clean or wipe them when dry.

Do not use any of the following on lamp covers:

- · Abrasive or caustic agents.

- · Washer fluids and other cleaning agents in higher concentrations than suggested by the manufacturer.
- · Ice scrapers or other hard items.
- · Solvents, alcohols, fuels, or other harsh cleaners.
- · Aftermarket appearance caps or covers while the lamps are illuminated, due to excessive heat generated.

## Caution

Failure to clean lamps properly can cause damage to the lamp cover that would not be covered by the vehicle warranty.

## Caution

Using wax on low gloss black finish stripes can increase the gloss level and create a non-uniform finish. Clean low gloss stripes with soap and water only.

## Air Intakes

Clear debris from the air intakes, between the hood and windshield, when washing the vehicle.

## Shutter System

<!-- image -->

The vehicle may have a shutter system designed to help improve fuel economy. Keep the shutter system clear of debris, snow, and ice. If the check engine light is activated, please check to see if the shutter system is clear of debris, snow, or ice.

## Windshield and Wiper Blades

Clean the outside of the windshield with glass cleaner.

Clean rubber blades using a lint-free cloth or paper towel soaked with windshield washer fluid or a mild detergent. Wash the windshield thoroughly when cleaning the

blades. Bugs, road grime, sap, and a buildup of vehicle wash/wax treatments may cause wiper streaking.

Replace the wiper blades if they are worn or damaged. Damage can be caused by extreme dusty conditions, sand, salt, heat, sun, snow, and ice.

## Weatherstrips

Apply weatherstrip lubricant on weatherstrips to make them last longer, seal better, and eliminate sticking or squeaking. Lubricate weatherstrips at least once a year. Hot, dry climates may require more frequent lubrication. Black marks from rubber material on painted surfaces can be removed by rubbing with a clean cloth. See Recommended Fluids and Lubricants 3 431 .

## Tires

Use a stiff brush with tire cleaner to clean the tires.

## Caution

Using petroleum-based tire dressing products on the vehicle may damage the paint finish and/or tires. When applying a tire dressing, always wipe off any overspray from all painted surfaces on the vehicle.

## Wheels and Wheel Trim

Use a soft, clean cloth with mild soap and water to clean the wheels. After rinsing thoroughly with clean water, dry with a soft, clean towel. Once dry, wax as desired.

## Caution

Chrome wheels and chrome wheel trim may be damaged if the vehicle is not washed after driving on roads that have been sprayed with magnesium chloride or calcium chloride. These are used on roads for conditions such as dust and ice. Always wash the chrome with soap and water after exposure.

## Caution

To avoid surface damage on wheels and wheel trim, do not use strong soaps, chemicals, abrasive polishes, cleaners, or brushes. Use only GM approved cleaners. Do not drive the vehicle through an automatic car wash that uses silicon carbide tire/wheel cleaning brushes. Damage could occur and the repairs would not be covered by the vehicle warranty.

## Brake System

Visually inspect brake lines and hoses for proper hook-up, binding, leaks, cracks, chafing, etc. Inspect disc brake pads for wear and rotors for surface condition. Inspect drum brake linings/shoes for wear or cracks. Inspect all other brake parts.

Visually check constant velocity joint boots and axle seals for leaks.

Control arm ball joints and outer tie rod ends are maintenance-free.

## Body Component Lubrication

Lubricate all key lock cylinders, hood hinges, liftgate hinges, steel fuel door hinge and power assist step hinges, unless the components are plastic. Applying silicone grease on weatherstrips with a clean cloth will make them last longer, seal better, and eliminate sticking or squeaking

## Underbody Maintenance

## Caution

Avoid pressure washing the vehicle frame. Use of high-pressure washers can result in removal of corrosion protection and possible vehicle damage.

At least twice a year, spring and fall, use plain water to flush any corrosive materials from the underbody. Take care to thoroughly clean any areas where mud and other debris can collect. If equipped with power assist steps, extend them and then use a high pressure wash to clean all joints and gaps.

Do not directly power wash the transfer case and/or front/rear axle output seals. High pressure water can overcome the seals and contaminate the fluid. Contaminated fluid will decrease the life of the transfer case and/or axles and should be replaced.

## Sheet Metal Damage

If the vehicle is damaged and requires sheet metal repair or replacement, make sure the body repair shop applies anti-corrosion material to parts repaired or replaced to restore corrosion protection.

Original manufacturer replacement parts will provide the corrosion protection while maintaining the vehicle warranty.

## Finish Damage

Quickly repair minor chips and scratches with touch-up materials available from your dealer to avoid corrosion. Larger areas of finish damage can be corrected in your dealer's body and paint shop.

## Chemical Paint Spotting

Airborne pollutants can fall upon and attack painted vehicle surfaces causing blotchy, ringshaped discolorations, and small, irregular dark spots etched into the paint surface. See 'Finish Care' previously in this section.

## Interior Care

To prevent dirt particle abrasions, regularly clean the vehicle's interior. Before using cleaners, read and follow all safety instructions on the label. While cleaning the interior, open the doors and windows to get proper ventilation. Newspapers or dark garments can transfer color to the vehicle's interior.

## Caution

Immediately remove cleaners, hand lotions, sunscreen, and insect repellent from all interior surfaces or permanent damage may result.

## Caution

Use cleaners specifically designed for the surfaces being cleaned to prevent permanent damage to the vehicle. Apply all cleaners directly to a cleaning cloth. Do not spray cleaners on any switches or controls.

When using liquid soap cleaners, follow the directions on the specific cleaner or soap solution for dilution instructions.

## Caution

## Caution (Continued)

vehicle, blot immediately and clean with a soft cloth dampened with a mild soap and water solution.

## Interior Glass

To clean, use a microfiber cloth fabric dampened with water. Wipe droplets left behind with a clean dry cloth. If necessary, use a commercial glass cleaner after cleaning with plain water.

## Caution

To prevent scratching, never use abrasive cleaners on automotive glass. Abrasive cleaners or aggressive cleaning may damage the rear window defogger.

Cleaning the windshield with water during the first three to six months of ownership will reduce tendency to fog.

## Speaker Covers

Vacuum around a speaker cover gently, so that the speaker will not be damaged. Clean spots with water and mild soap.

## Coated Moldings

Coated moldings should be cleaned.

- · When heavily soiled, use warm soapy water.
- · When lightly soiled, wipe with a sponge or soft, lint-free cloth dampened with water.

## Vinyl/Rubber

If equipped with vinyl floor and rubber floor mats, use a soft cloth and/or brush dampened with water to remove dust and loose dirt. For more thorough cleaning, use a mild soap and water solution.

<!-- image -->

## Warning

Do not use cleaners that contain silicone, wax-based products, or cleaners that increase gloss on vinyl/rubber floor and mats. These cleaners can permanently change the appearance and feel of the vinyl/rubber and can make the floor slippery. Your foot could slip while operating the vehicle, and you could lose control, resulting in a crash. You or others could be injured.

## Fabric/Carpet/Suede

Start by vacuuming the surface using a soft brush attachment. If a rotating vacuum brush attachment is being used, only use it on the floor carpet. Before cleaning, gently remove as much of the soil as possible:

- · For solid soils, remove as much as possible prior to vacuuming.
- · Gently blot liquids with a paper towel. Continue blotting until no more soil can be removed.

To clean:

- 1. Saturate a clean, lint-free colorfast cloth with water. Microfiber cloth is recommended to prevent lint transfer to the fabric or carpet.
- 2. Remove excess moisture by gently wringing until water does not drip from the cleaning cloth.
- 3. Start on the outside edge of the soil and gently rub toward the center. Fold the cleaning cloth to a clean area frequently to prevent forcing the soil into the fabric.
- 4. Continue gently rubbing the soiled area until there is no longer any color transfer from the soil to the cleaning cloth.
- 5. If the soil is not completely removed, use a mild soap solution followed only by plain water.

If the soil is not completely removed, it may be necessary to use a commercial upholstery cleaner or spot lifter. Test a small hidden area for colorfastness before using a commercial upholstery cleaner or spot lifter. If ring formation occurs, clean the entire fabric or carpet.

After cleaning, use a paper towel to blot excess moisture.

## Cleaning High Gloss Surfaces and Vehicle Information and Radio Displays

Use a microfiber cloth on high gloss surfaces or vehicle displays. First, use a soft bristle brush to remove dirt that can scratch the surface. Then gently clean by rubbing with a microfiber cloth. Never use window cleaners or solvents. Periodically hand wash the microfiber cloth separately, using mild soap. Do not use bleach or fabric softener. Rinse thoroughly and air dry before next use.

## Caution

Do not attach a device with a suction cup to the display. This may cause damage and would not be covered by the vehicle warranty.

Instrument Panel, Leather, Vinyl, Other Plastic Surfaces, Low Gloss Paint Surfaces, and Natural Open Pore Wood Surfaces

## Caution

Soaking or saturating leather, especially perforated leather, as well as other interior surfaces, may cause permanent damage. Wipe excess moisture from these surfaces after cleaning and allow them to dry naturally. Never use heat, steam, or spot removers. Do not use liquids that contain alcohol or solvents on leather seats. Do not use cleaners that contain silicone or wax-based products. Cleaners containing these solvents can permanently change the appearance and feel of leather or soft trim and are not recommended.

## Caution

Use of air fresheners may cause permanent damage to plastics and painted surfaces. If an air freshener comes in contact with any plastic or painted surface in the vehicle, blot immediately and clean with a soft cloth dampened with a mild soap solution. Damage caused by air fresheners would not be covered by the vehicle warranty.

Use compressed air or a vacuum to remove dust under the Multi-Function Controller (MFC) cap, if equipped.

Use a soft bristle brush to remove dust from knobs and crevices on the instrument cluster. Use a soft microfiber cloth dampened with water to remove dust and loose dirt. For a more thorough cleaning, use a soft microfiber cloth dampened with a mild soap and water solution.

Do not use cleaners that increase gloss, especially on the instrument panel. Reflected glare can decrease visibility through the windshield under certain conditions.

## Customer Information

## Customer Satisfaction Procedure

Your satisfaction and goodwill are important to your dealer and to Cadillac. Normally, any concerns with the sales transaction or the operation of the vehicle will be resolved by your dealer's sales or service departments. Sometimes, however, despite the best intentions of all concerned, misunderstandings can occur. If your concern has not been resolved to your satisfaction, the following steps should be taken:

STEP ONE: Discuss your concern with a member of dealership management. Normally, concerns can be quickly resolved at that level. If the matter has already been reviewed with the sales, service or parts manager, contact the owner of your dealership or the general manager.

STEP TWO: If after contacting a member of dealership management, it appears your concern cannot be resolved by your dealership without further help, in the U.S., call the Cadillac Customer Assistance Center at 1-800458-8006. In Canada, call the Canadian Cadillac Customer Care Centre at 1-888-446-2000.

We encourage you to call the toll-free number in order to give your inquiry prompt attention. Have the following information available to give the Customer Assistance representative:

- · Dealership name and location.
- · Vehicle Identification Number (VIN). This is available from the vehicle registration or title, or the plate at the top left of the instrument panel and visible through the windshield.
- · Vehicle delivery date and present mileage.

When contacting Cadillac, remember that your concern will likely be resolved at a dealer's facility. That is why we suggest following Step One first.

STEP THREE - U.S. Owners: Both General Motors and your dealer are committed to making sure you are completely satisfied with the new vehicle. However, if you continue to remain unsatisfied after following the procedure outlined in Steps One and Two, you can file with the Better Business Bureau (BBB) AUTO LINE Program to enforce your rights.

The BBB AUTO LINE Program is an out-ofcourt program administered by BBB National Programs, Inc. to settle automotive disputes regarding vehicle repairs or the interpretation

of the New Vehicle Limited Warranty. Although you may be required to resort to this informal dispute resolution program prior to filing a court action, use of the program is free of charge and your case will generally be heard within 40 days. If you do not agree with the decision given in your case, you may reject it and proceed with any other venue for relief available to you.

You may contact the BBB AUTO LINE Program using the toll-free telephone number or write them at the following address:

BBB AUTO LINE a Division of BBB National Programs, Inc. 1676 International Drive Suite 550 McLean, VA 22102

Telephone: 1-800-955-5100 www.bbbautoline.org

This program is available in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Eligibility is limited by vehicle age, mileage, and other factors. General Motors reserves the right to change eligibility limitations and/or discontinue its participation in this program.

STEP THREE - Canadian Owners: In the event that you do not feel your concerns have been addressed after following the procedure outlined in Steps One and Two, General Motors of Canada Company wants you to be aware of its participation in a no-charge mediation/ arbitration program. General Motors of Canada Company has committed to binding arbitration of owner disputes involving factory-related vehicle service claims. The program provides for the review of the facts involved by an impartial third party arbiter, and may include an informal hearing before the arbiter. The program is designed so that the entire dispute settlement process, from the time you file your complaint to the final decision, should be completed in about 70 days. We believe our impartial program offers advantages over courts in most jurisdictions because it is informal, quick, and free of charge.

For further information concerning eligibility in the Canadian Motor Vehicle Arbitration Plan (CAMVAP), call toll-free 1-800-207-0685, or call the Cadillac Customer Care Centre, 1-888-446-2000, or write to:

may be reimbursed during the Powertrain warranty period. Items considered are hotel, meals, and rental car or a vehicle being delivered back to the customer, up to 500 miles.

## Cadillac Technician Roadside Assistance (U.S. Only)

Cadillac's exceptional Roadside Assistance is more than an auto club or towing service. It provides every Cadillac owner in the United States with the advantage of contacting a Cadillac advisor and, where available, a Cadillac trained dealer technician who can provide on-site service.

A dealer technician will travel to your location within a 30-mile radius of a participating Cadillac dealership. If beyond this radius, we will arrange to have your car towed to the nearest Cadillac dealership. Each technician travels with a specially equipped service vehicle complete with the necessary Cadillac parts and tools required to handle most roadside repairs.

## Services Not Included in Roadside Assistance

- · Legal fines
- · Impound towing caused by violation of any laws
- · Mounting, dismounting, or changing of snow tires, chains, or other traction devices

Service is not provided if a vehicle is in an area that is not accessible to the service vehicle or is not a regularly traveled or maintained public road, which includes ice and winter roads. Off-road use is not covered.

## Services Specific to CanadianPurchased Vehicles

- · Lock-Out Service: Vehicle registration is required.
- · Fuel delivery: Reimbursement is up to 7 liters. Diesel fuel delivery may be restricted. Propane and other fuels are not provided through this service.
- · Trip Interruption Benefits and Assistance: Must be traveling and over 150 km from where your trip was started to qualify. Preauthorization, original detailed receipts, and a copy of the repair orders are required.

Once authorization has been received, the Roadside Assistance advisor will help you make arrangements and explain how to receive payment. Items considered are hotel, meals, and rental car or a vehicle being delivered back to the customer, up to 800 km.

- · Alternative Service: If assistance cannot be provided right away, the Roadside Assistance advisor may give you permission to get local emergency road service. You will receive payment, up to $100, after sending the original receipt to Roadside Assistance. Mechanical failures may be covered, however any cost for parts and labor for repairs not covered by the warranty are the owner responsibility.

## Scheduling Service Appointments

When the vehicle requires warranty service, contact your dealer and request an appointment. By scheduling a service appointment and advising the service consultant of your transportation needs, your dealer can help minimize your inconvenience.

If the vehicle cannot be scheduled into the service department immediately, keep driving it until it can be scheduled for service, unless,

of course, the problem is safety related. If it is, please call your dealership, let them know this, and ask for instructions.

If your dealer requests you to bring the vehicle for service, you are urged to do so as early in the work day as possible to allow for sameday repair.

## Courtesy Transportation Program

To enhance your ownership experience, we and our participating dealers are proud to offer Courtesy Transportation, a customer support program for vehicles with the Bumper-to-Bumper (Base Warranty Coverage period in Canada), Federal Emission, Extended Powertrain or Electric specific warranties in both the U.S. and Canada.

Several Courtesy Transportation options are available to assist in reducing inconvenience when warranty repairs are required.

Courtesy Transportation is not a part of the New Vehicle Limited Warranty. A separate manual entitled 'Limited Warranty and Owner Assistance Information' produced for new vehicles provides detailed warranty coverage information.

## Transportation Options

Warranty service can generally be completed while you wait. However, if you are unable to do so, your dealer may offer the following transportation options:

## Shuttle Service

This includes one-way or round-trip shuttle service within reasonable time and distance parameters of your dealer's area.

## Public Transportation or Fuel Reimbursement

If overnight warranty repairs are needed, and public transportation is used, the expense must be supported by original receipts and within the maximum amount allowed by GM. If U.S. customers arrange their own transportation, limited reimbursement for reasonable fuel expenses may be available. Claim amounts should reflect actual costs and be supported by original receipts. See your dealer for information.

## Courtesy Rental Vehicle

For an overnight warranty repair, the dealer may provide an available courtesy rental vehicle or provide for reimbursement of a rental vehicle. Reimbursement is limited

and must be supported by original receipts as well as a signed and completed rental agreement and meet state/provincial, local, and rental vehicle provider requirements. Requirements vary and may include minimum age requirements, insurance coverage, credit card, etc. Additional fees such as fuel, rental vehicle insurance, taxes, levies, usage fees, excessive mileage, or rental usage beyond the completion of the repair are also your responsibility.

It may not be possible to provide a like vehicle as a courtesy rental.

## Additional Program Information

All program options, such as shuttle service, may not be available at every dealer. Contact your dealer for specific availability.

General Motors reserves the right to unilaterally modify, change, or discontinue Courtesy Transportation at any time and to resolve all questions of claim eligibility pursuant to the terms and conditions described herein at its sole discretion.

## Collision Damage Repair

If the vehicle is involved in a collision and it is damaged, have the damage repaired by a qualified technician using the proper equipment and quality replacement parts. Poorly performed collision repairs diminish the vehicle resale value, and safety performance can be compromised in subsequent collisions.

## Collision Parts

Genuine GM Collision parts are new parts made with the same materials and construction methods as the parts with which the vehicle was originally built. Genuine GM Collision parts are the best choice to ensure that the vehicle's designed appearance, durability, and safety are preserved. The use of Genuine GM parts can help maintain the GM New Vehicle Limited Warranty.

Recycled original equipment parts may also be used for repair. These parts are typically removed from vehicles that were total losses in prior crashes. In most cases, the parts being recycled are from undamaged sections of the vehicle. A recycled original equipment GM part may be an acceptable choice to maintain the vehicle's originally designed appearance and safety performance; however, the history

of these parts is not known. Such parts are not covered by the GM New Vehicle Limited Warranty, and any related failures are not covered by that warranty.

Aftermarket collision parts are also available. These are made by companies other than GM and may not have been tested for the vehicle. As a result, these parts may fit poorly, exhibit premature durability/corrosion problems, and may not perform properly in subsequent collisions. Aftermarket parts are not covered by the GM New Vehicle Limited Warranty, and any vehicle failure related to such parts is not covered by that warranty.

## Repair Facility

GM also recommends that you choose a collision repair facility that meets your needs before you ever need collision repairs. Your dealer may have a collision repair center with GM-trained technicians and state-of-the-art equipment, or be able to recommend a collision repair center that has GM-trained technicians and comparable equipment.

## Insuring the Vehicle

Protect your investment in the GM vehicle with comprehensive and collision insurance coverage. There are significant differences in the quality of coverage afforded by various insurance policy terms. Many insurance policies provide reduced protection to the GM vehicle by limiting compensation for damage repairs by using aftermarket collision parts. Some insurance companies will not specify aftermarket collision parts. When purchasing insurance, we recommend that you ensure that the vehicle will be repaired with GM original equipment collision parts. If such insurance coverage is not available from your current insurance carrier, consider switching to another insurance carrier.

If the vehicle is leased, the leasing company may require you to have insurance that ensures repairs with Genuine GM Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) parts or Genuine Manufacturer replacement parts. Read the lease carefully, as you may be charged at the end of the lease for poor quality repairs.

## If a Crash Occurs

If there has been an injury, call emergency services for help. Do not leave the scene of a crash until all matters have been taken care of. Move the vehicle only if its position puts you in danger, or you are instructed to move it by a police officer.

Give only the necessary information to police and other parties involved in the crash.

For emergency towing, see Roadside Assistance Program 3 443 .

Gather the following information:

- · Driver license number
- · Driver name, address, and telephone number
- · Owner name, address, and telephone number
- · Vehicle make, model, and model year
- · Vehicle license plate number
- · Vehicle Identification Number (VIN)
- · General description of the damage to the other vehicle
- · Insurance company and policy number

Choose a reputable repair facility that uses quality replacement parts. See 'Collision Parts' earlier in this section.

If the airbag has inflated, see What Will You See after an Airbag Inflates? 3 68 .

## Managing the Vehicle Damage Repair Process

In the event that the vehicle requires damage repairs, GM recommends that you take an active role in its repair. If you have a predetermined repair facility of choice, take the vehicle there, or have it towed there. Specify to the facility that any required replacement collision parts be original equipment parts, either new Genuine GM parts or recycled original GM parts. Remember, recycled parts will not be covered by the GM vehicle warranty.

Insurance pays the bill for the repair, but you must live with the repair. Depending on your policy limits, your insurance company may initially value the repair using aftermarket parts. Discuss this with the repair professional, and insist on Genuine GM parts. Remember, if the vehicle is leased, you may be obligated to have the vehicle repaired with Genuine GM parts, even if your insurance coverage does not pay the full cost.

If another party's insurance company is paying for the repairs, you are not obligated to accept a repair valuation based on that insurance company's collision policy repair limits, as you have no contractual limits with that company. In such cases, you can have control of the repair and parts choices as long as the cost stays within reasonable limits.

## Vehicle Data Recording and Privacy

The vehicle has a number of computers that record information about the vehicle's performance and how it is driven or used. For example, the vehicle uses computer modules to monitor and control engine and transmission performance, to monitor the conditions for airbag deployment and deploy them in a crash, and, if equipped, to provide antilock braking to help the driver control the vehicle. These modules may store data to help the dealer technician service the vehicle or to help GM improve safety or features. Some modules may also store data about how the vehicle is operated, such as rate of fuel consumption or average speed. These modules may retain personal preferences, such as radio presets, seat positions, and temperature settings.

## Cybersecurity

GM collects information about the use of your vehicle including operational and safety related information. We collect this information to provide, evaluate, improve, and troubleshoot our products and services and to develop new products and services.

The protection of vehicle electronics systems and customer data from unauthorized outside electronic access or control is important to GM. GM maintains appropriate security standards, practices, guidelines and controls aimed at defending the vehicle and the vehicle service ecosystem against unauthorized electronic access, detecting possible malicious activity in related networks, and responding to suspected cybersecurity incidents in a timely, coordinated and effective manner. Security incidents could impact your safety or compromise your private data. To minimize security risks, please do not connect your vehicle electronic systems to unauthorized devices or connect your vehicle to any unknown or untrusted networks (such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi or similar technology). In the event you suspect any security incident impacting your data or the safe operation of your vehicle, please stop operating your vehicle and contact your dealer.

## Event Data Recorders

This vehicle is equipped with an Event Data Recorder (EDR). The main purpose of an EDR is to record, in certain crash or near crash-like situations, such as an air bag deployment or

hitting a road obstacle, data that will assist in understanding how a vehicle's systems performed. The EDR is designed to record data related to vehicle dynamics and safety systems for a short period of time, typically 30 seconds or less. The EDR in this vehicle is designed to record such data as:

- · Whether or not the driver and passenger safety belts were buckled/fastened;
- · How various systems in your vehicle were operating;
- · How far (if at all) the driver was depressing the accelerator and/or brake pedal; and,

These data can help provide a better understanding of the circumstances in which crashes and injuries occur.

- · How fast the vehicle was traveling.

## Note

EDR data are recorded by your vehicle only if a non-trivial crash situation occurs; no data are recorded by the EDR under normal driving conditions and no personal data (e.g., name, gender, age, and crash location) are recorded. However, other parties, such as law enforcement, could combine

the EDR data with the type of personally identifying data routinely acquired during a crash investigation.

To read data recorded by an EDR, special equipment is required, and access to the vehicle or the EDR is needed. In addition to the vehicle manufacturer, other parties, such as law enforcement, that have the special equipment, can read the information if they have access to the vehicle or the EDR.

GM will not access these data or share it with others except: with the consent of the vehicle owner or, if the vehicle is leased, with the consent of the lessee; in response to an official request by police or similar government office; as part of GM's defense of litigation through the discovery process; or, as permitted by law. Data that GM collects or receives may also be used for GM research needs or may be made available to others for research purposes, where a need is shown and the data is not tied to a specific vehicle or vehicle owner.

## OnStar

If the vehicle is equipped with OnStar and has an active service plan, additional data may be collected and transmitted through the OnStar system. This includes information about the

vehicle's operation; collisions involving the vehicle; the use of the vehicle and its features, including infotainment; and the location and approximate GPS speed of the vehicle. Refer to the OnStar Terms and Conditions and Privacy Statement on the OnStar website.

See OnStar Additional Information 3 454 .

## Infotainment System

If the vehicle is equipped with a navigation system as part of the infotainment system, use of the system may result in the storage of destinations, addresses, telephone numbers, and other trip information. See the infotainment section for information on stored data and for deletion instructions.
